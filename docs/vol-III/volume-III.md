This is the third book of the series EXPLORING MODERN PHYSICS VIA NOBEL PRIZES. It concerns waves which are mathematical representations of oscillatory processes and physical descriptions of phenomena involving transfer of matter, energy, information, …

An appropriate mechanical description of the energy states of the electron and its movements around the nucleus gave rise to what was called wave mechanics because the movements of electrons were treated in terms of probabilistic matter waves. Afterwards, the name was changed into quantum mechanics implying that the movement is quantized both for radiation in terms of photons and for matter composed of atoms that are no longer indivisible and contains electrons in quantized energy states. The treatment of quantum waves has been fundamental in the study of condensed matter physics and in the treatment of electromagnetic and gravitational waves in astrophysical studies.
