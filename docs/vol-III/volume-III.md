# III.  WAVES


This is the third book of the series EXPLORING MODERN PHYSICS VIA NOBEL PRIZES. It concerns waves which are both: mathematical representations of oscillatory processes and physical descriptions of phenomena involving transfer of matter, energy, information, â€¦The content of this Volume is the following:

<blockquote>
