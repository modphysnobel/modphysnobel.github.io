## 12.3.	Analysis of learning trajectories.

Albert Einstein predicted the phenomena of condensation in a paper with the title of *“Quantentheorie des einatomigen idealen gases”* published in July 1924, when he was a mature and well recognized physicists of 45 years of age. The phenomena was experimentally discovered till 1994 by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle. What and how did Einstein learn to be able to make a theoretical prediction that was experimentally verified after 70 years? An answer to this question can be related to how prescriptive learning and emergent learning were present in Einstein´s life.

Unlike what is simple to learn and has been previously prescribed, learning the new is difficult, especially in recently explored topics, when important problems are poorly explained or badly solved; also when writing lacks precision, coherence and clarity. Prescriptive learning and emergent learning consider in different ways how the following elements are described in next Table.

!!! info "Albert Einstein learning trayectory."

	Einstein’s life began in Ulm, Germany on March 14, 1879, and ended in Princeton, United States on April 18, 1955. For more information see the references at the end of the chapter. Next, we might ask in what types of *schools* did he learn.

	*Punitive barrack whose objective was to obey*.  His preuniversity learning was subjected to a traditional German instruction almost exclusively reduced to the transmission of information that had to be accepted and digested without questioning. Although he excelled in mathematics and physics, his school performance was mediocre and sometimes even poor. He paid little attention to the requirements of prescriptive learning related to encyclopedic-type content, implied conventional rote procedures, mainly expressed in terms of dogmatic, sectarian or authoritarian attitudes. He challenged systems and institutions and as an original and persistent autodidact, he began to generate some emerging learning of great creativity that he would later apply in all his intellectual productions.

	*Efficient factory whose objective was to produce*. He could not be accepted to study physics at a university; after several attempts he was accepted at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. He independently learned what was prescriptive but interested him, and he took time to work on emerging learning outside what was established. Instead of repeating other people's ideas, he thought and persistently followed challenging questions that apparently made no sense. On December 13, 1900 he sent to the journal *Annalen der Physik*  his first scientific paper at the age of twenty-one.

	*Emotional festival whose objective was to create*. Throughout his life, his research work was empowered by a continuous emergent learning that made possible a unique scientific career where three epochs can be identified: 

	(1)	*Revolutionary explosion*. In a period of 195 days five publications were submitted and accepted and at the end of the same year a sixth paper was submitted; he was 26 years old. Although those publications were written in German, in the second column of next Table 12.2 all the titles are in English. It is remarkable how self-explanatory are those titles.

	(2) *Leadership in theoretical physics*. . His realistic position regarding the existence of atoms and molecules remained against the opinion of many physicists in the early twentieth century. He convinced through the explanatory and predictive value of his theories. As an example of this capacity Table 12.3 indicates the number of years elapsed between five Einstein theoretical prediction and the experimental observation or production of the phenomenon in consideration.

	(3) *Search and discrepancy.* During many years he concentrated on problems that remained unresolved, like a unified field treatment of gravitational and quantum phenomena. He participated also in debates with Niels Bohr (1885-1962) about the interpretation of quantum mechanics and with David Hilbert (1862-1943) about the formulation of gravitational theories. Although his emergent learnings was declining, he published several books and wrote many letters and articles about philosophy of science, pacifism, politics, education, morality, cosmic religiosity, ...

	By all means, a lot of learning can be obtained from Einstein´s learning trajectory.
