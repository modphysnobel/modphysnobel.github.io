## 12.2.	Quantum Hall effects.

The Hall effect was discovered in 1879 by Edwin H. Hall (1855-1938). When an electric current flows through a conductor like a thin gold plate which is located in a magnetic field, this field exerts a transverse force on the carrier of moving charges, which tends to push them to one side of the conductor. The accumulation of charges on the sides of the conductor will balance the magnetic force, producing a measurable voltage between the two sides of the conductor. Such potential drop is at right angles both to the current and the magnetic field. Hall performed his experiments at room temperature and with moderate magnetic fields of less than one tesla (T). One century after, Hall effect has been observed at extremely low temperatures (only a few degrees from absolute zero, i.e. around -272°C) and very powerful magnetic fields (max approx. 30 T).

In what follows we refer to the 1985 Physics Nobel Prize awarded to Klaus von Klitzing “for the discovery of the quantized Hall effect” and to the 1998 Prize awarded to Robert B. Laughlin, Horst L. Störmer and Daniel C. Tsui “for their discovery of a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations”. Next, we present the documents called WORK describing the main contributions made by the laureates and the title and subtitles of their Nobel Lectures. Afterwards, we present some information taken from the document *Press release. Electrons in New Guises* and insert some figures taken from the Nobel Lectures by von Klitzing and by Störmer. The appropriate references in MLA format are given at the end of the chapter.

	WORK (von Klitzing): “If an electrical current flows lengthwise through a metal band and a magnetic field is placed against the surface of the band at a right angle, a charge arises diagonally in the band. Known as the Hall effect, it comes about because the movement of the electrons is deflected by the magnetic field. In 1980, Klaus von Klitzing discovered the quantum Hall effect in an interface between a metal and a semiconductor in a very clean material. In this effect, changes in the magnetic field result in changes in what is known as Hall conductance that vary in steps of whole-number multiples of a constant.”

In 1980, Klaus von Klitzing discovered the quantum Hall effect in an interface between a metal and a semiconductor in a very clean material. At very low temperatures the electrons moved as in two dimensions only, and changes in the magnetic field resulted in changes in the Hall conductance that does not vary in linear fashion, but “stepwise”. The quantized values of the Hall resistance $R_H$ were $(h/e2)/f$, where $h$ is Planck’s constant, $e$ is the elementary charge of the electron and $f$ (the filling factor) is an integer number. According to von Klitzing, the fact that normal Ohmic resistance disappeared was an indication that the material became a sort of a superconductor. Next Figures 12.8 and 12.9 come from his Nobel Lecture The Quantized Hall Effect.

**Figure 12.9.** Experimental results reported in von Klitzing Nobel Lecture; ($h$ is Planck constant and $e$ the charge of the electron).

In experiments with the electron gas realized during 1982-1983, Störmer and Tsui worked on more severe conditions of temperatures and magnetic fields (around -272°C and nearly 30 T). Although the electrons are most reluctant to condense (they are fermions) they combine with the “flux quanta” of the magnetic field and form composite particles that can condense (they become bosons). Störmer and Tsui found Hall plateaus at high magnetic field strengths corresponding to fractional values of the filling factor $f$. This implied the existence of quasiparticles carrying fractional charge; for instance if $f=1/3$ this would correspond to a fractional charge of $e/3$.

In his 1998 Nobel Lecture $The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect$ Störmer explains the main difference between IQHE (Integer Quantum Hall Effect) and FQHE (Fractional Quantum Hall Effect): “The IQHE can be understood solely on the basis of the quantized motion of individual 2D electrons in the presence of a magnetic field and random fluctuations of the interface potential which creates localized states. …. The origin of FQHE is interaction between electrons. It is therefore termed a many-particle effect or an electron correlation effect, since the charged electrons are avoiding each other by correlating their relative motion in an intricate manner.” (See Figure 12.10 taken from Störmer´s Nobel Lecture.)

**Figure 12.10.** Hall Resistance ($R_H$) showing many fractional values.

Although the electrons usually repel each other because they are fermions, according to Laughlin the reported fractional quantization was because in the presence of very strong magnetic fields the electron gas behaved as a new type of quantum fluid integrated by composite interacting fermions (the electrons) that behave as bosons and condense as fractionally charged “quasiparticles”. Laughlin, closed his Nobel lecture *Fractional Quantization* by saying: “Fractional quantum Hall quasiparticles are the elementary excitations of a distinct state of matter that cannot be deformed into noninteracting electrons without crossing a phase boundary. That means they are different from electrons in the only sensible way we have of defining different, and in particular are not adiabatic images of electrons the way quasiparticle excitations of metals and band insulators are.”
