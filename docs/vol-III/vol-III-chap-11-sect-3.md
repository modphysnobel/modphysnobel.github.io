## 11.3. Phases in a learning and research process.

In this section we describe Geim´s Lecture *Random Walk to Graphene* as a learning and research process that involves two structural phases:  

•	The learning phase is for inquiring and exploring and comprehend the steps of motivation and problematization in connection with the acquisition of existing knowledge and the development of skills.  

•	The research phase is for evaluating and communicating and consists in the description of the testing, discovery and publishing concerning the steps of experimentation and problematization for the development and application of new knowledge and the confrontation with external ideas, methods, and results. 

In what follows we present a set of Tables describing the content of Geim´s Lecture. The title of each Table refers to the corresponding subtitle included in the original document.  The first column in the Table describes reported activities by directly quoting or summarizing what is written in each section of the Lecture. The next five columns of the Table refer to those steps that we consider mainly correspond to motivation (Motv), problematization (Prob), experimentation (Expm), testing (Tstn), or publication (Publ). We indicate with an X the steps that we estimate have been predominantly involved in each activity. For simplicity, we omit many names and simplify the descriptions of such  activities. These tables represent the trajectory of a learning and research process that started with a PhD dissertation and lead to a Nobel Prize.

Geim starts his Nobel Lecture with this remark: “I hope that the reader will excuse me if on this occasion I recommend my own writings [1–3]. Instead of repeating myself here, I have chosen to describe my twisty scientific road that eventually led to the Nobel Prize. Most parts of this story are not described anywhere else, and its timeline covers the period from my PhD in 1987 to the moment when our 2004 paper, recognized by the Nobel Committee, was accepted for publication.”

Silver paint was employed to make electrical contacts to graphite platelets transferred from the Scotch tape. The prepared material resulted with higher conductivity and reasonably low resistance.

Transfer of graphite crystal from the tape was made by using tweezers to make four closely spaced contacts required for the application of voltage; the fingers were used to apply silver paint with a toothpick. The crystal was nearly 20 nm thick and its lateral size comparable to the diameter of a human hair.
