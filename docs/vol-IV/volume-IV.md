This is the fourth book of the series _EXPLORING MODERN PHYSICS VIA NOBEL PRIZES_. It refers to understanding the universe. According to Carl Sagan: “the universe is all that existed, exists and will exist”. Understanding requires asking questions and proposing answers that foster the improvement of knowledge. It means to bite the unknown.

The study of the universe is like archaeology in the sense that it concerns the reconstruction of what is past and like history because it consists in the interpretation of what has been registered. Natural sciences deal with objects and forces acting in macroscopic regions at the beginning of time and in microscopic regions observed in modern accelerators of particles. Social sciences refer to individuals and their evolving groups whose properties and tendencies are studied in terms of these microscopic or macroscopic reference systems. The traces of the past serve to interpret the present and propose radiographies of possible futures.

We review and comment those essential nodes of a cognitive network of explanations, discoveries, and inventions that have been recognized with Physics Nobel Prizes and Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Theories and experiments and the ways of building and applying concepts and models are quite different in universes integrated by particle or waves and energy, as compared with those universes where the participants are humans and communities. In both universes Mathematics are bridges for solving problems and ladders for attaining better and better explanations. 

Sometimes in natural and social sciences, the facts and their probable causes were explained and communicated in coherent and consistent ways before observable and measurable results were explained. Sometimes the descriptions of the origins and conditions of the results and their consequences were required before the synthesis of their representations, interpretations and predictions were proposed and tested.
