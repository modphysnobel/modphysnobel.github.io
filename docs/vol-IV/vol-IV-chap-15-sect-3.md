## 15.3.  Interpretation of natural experiments in Economic sciences.

This Section refers to the 2021 Prize; it does not consider the Prize awarded to David Card “for his empirical contributions to labour economics”; it concentrates on the Prize awarded the same year to Joshua D. Angrist and Guido W. Imbens “for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships”. In what follows we include excerpts from two documents *Press release* and *Popular information*. References to videos corresponding to individual Prize Lectures and the previously mentioned documents are indicated at the end of the chapter.

!!! bug "Press release: *Natural experiments help answer important questions for society.*"
	
	“This year’s Laureates – David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens – have provided us with new insights about the labour market and shown what conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Their approach has spread to other fields and revolutionised empirical research.”

	“Many of the big questions in the social sciences deal with cause and effect. How does immigration affect pay and employment levels? How does a longer education affect someone’s future income? These questions are difficult to answer because we have nothing to use as a comparison. We do not know what would have happened if there had been less immigration or if that person had not continued studying.”

	“However, this year’s Laureates have shown that it is possible to answer these and similar questions using *natural experiments*. The key is to use situations in which chance events or policy changes result in groups of people being treated differently, in a way that resembles clinical trials in medicine.”

	“Using natural experiments, *David Card* has analysed the labour market effects of minimum wages, immigration and education. His studies from the early 1990s challenged conventional wisdom, leading to new analyses and additional insights. The results showed, among other things, that increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs. We now know that the incomes of people who were born in a country can benefit from new immigration, while people who immigrated at an earlier time risk being negatively affected. We have also realised that resources in schools are far more important for students’ future labour market success than was previously thought.”

	“Data from a natural experiment are difficult to interpret, however. For example, extending compulsory education by a year for one group of students (but not another) will not affect everyone in that group in the same way. Some students would have kept studying anyway and, for them, the value of education is often not representative of the entire group. So, is it even possible to draw any conclusions about the effect of an extra year in school? In the mid-1990s, *Joshua Angrist* and *Guido Imbens* solved this methodological problem, demonstrating how precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments.”
	
	“Card’s studies of core questions for society and Angrist and Imbens’ methodological contributions have shown that natural experiments are a rich source of knowledge. Their research has substantially improved our ability to answer key causal questions, which has been of great benefit to society,” says Peter Fredriksson, chair of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee.

!!! quote "Popular information: *Natural experiments help answer important questions.*"

	“If we are to make good decisions, we must understand the consequences of our choices. ….. However, answering broad questions about cause and effect is not easy, because we will never know what would have happened if we had made a different choice.”

	“One way of establishing causality is to use randomised experiments, where researchers allocate individuals to treatment groups by a random draw. This method is used to investigate the efficacy of new medicines, among other things, but is not suitable for investigating many societal issues – for example, we cannot have a randomised experiment determining who gets to attend upper-secondary school and who does not.”

	“Despite these challenges, the Laureates have demonstrated that many of society’s big questions can be answered. Their solution is to use natural experiments – situations arising in real life that resemble randomised experiments. These natural experiments may be due to natural random variations, institutional rules or policy changes. In pioneering work from the early 1990s, David Card analysed some central questions in labour economics – such as the effects of a minimum wage, immigration and education – using this approach.” ….

	…..
	“Natural experiments differ from clinical trials in one important way – in a clinical trial, the researcher has complete control over who is offered a treatment and eventually receives it (the treatment group) and who is not offered the treatment and therefore does not receive it (the control group). In a natural experiment, the researcher also has access to data from treatment and control groups but, unlike a clinical trial, the individuals may themselves have chosen whether they want to participate in the intervention being offered. This makes it much more difficult to interpret the results of a natural experiment. In an innovative study from 1994, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens showed what conclusions about causation can be drawn from natural experiments in which people cannot be forced to participate in the programme being studied (nor forbidden from doing so). The framework they created has radically changed how researchers approach empirical questions using data from natural experiments or randomised field experiments.”

	*One example of a natural experiment*

	“Let us use a concrete example to illustrate how a natural experiment works. One question that is relevant to both society and to young people considering their future, is how much more you would earn if you chose to study longer.” …..
		
	…..
	“It would be easy to believe that situations which enable natural experiments are very unusual, especially those that can be used to answer important questions. ….  There is thus unintended randomness that divides people into control and treatment groups, providing researchers with opportunities for uncovering causal relationships.”

	*Understanding labour markets*

	*The effects of a minimum wage*

	“In the early 1990s, the conventional wisdom among economists was that higher minimum wages lead to lower employment because they increase wage costs for businesses. …. Reverse causation could even be the issue: when unemployment rises, employers can set lower wages which, in turn, may lead to demands to increase the minimum wage.”

	“To investigate how increased minimum wages affect employment, Card and Krueger used a natural experiment. …. As with randomised experiments, a control group was needed, i.e., a group where wages didn’t change but all the other factors were the same.”

	…..
	“Card and Krueger focused on employment in fast-food restaurants, an industry where pay is low and minimum wages matter. …..  The overall conclusion is that the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage are small, and significantly smaller than was believed 30 years ago.”

	“The work conducted by Card at the beginning of the 1990s also led to new research, which attempted to explain the absence of negative effects on employment. ….. The many studies inspired by Card and Krueger’s work have considerably improved our understanding of the labour market.”
	
	*Research on immigration and education*

	“Another important issue is how the labour market is affected by immigration. To answer this question, we need to know what would have happened if there had not been any immigration.” ….. “To examine how this huge influx of workers affected the labour market in Miami, David Card compared the wage and employment trends in Miami with the evolution of wages and employment in four comparison cities.”

	“Despite the enormous increase in labour supply, Card found no negative effects for Miami residents with low levels of education. Wages did not fall and unemployment did not increase relative to the other cities. This study generated large amounts of new empirical work, and we now have a better understanding of the effects of immigration.”…..

	…..  “Card and Krueger found that resources are important: returns on education increased with teacher density in the state in which the individuals had grown up.”

	“This research also inspired many new studies. There is now relatively strong empirical support to show that investments in education influence students’ later success on the labour market. This effect is particularly strong for students from disadvantaged backgrounds”.

	*A new framework for studies of causal relationships*

	“In all realistic scenarios, the effect of an intervention – for example, the effect of additional schooling on earnings – varies between people. Moreover, individuals are affected differently by a natural experiment. …. How can a causal relationship between education and income be established?”

	“Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens tackled this problem in an influential study from the mid-1990s. More specifically, they asked the following question: Under which conditions can we use a natural experiment to estimate the effects of a particular intervention, such as a computing course, when the effects vary between individuals and we do not have complete control of who participates? How can we estimate this effect and how should it be interpreted?”

	“Somewhat simplified, we can imagine a natural experiment as if it randomly divides individuals into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group is entitled to participate in a programme while the control group is not. Angrist and Imbens showed that it is possible to estimate the effect of the programme by applying a two-step process (known as the instrumental variables method). The first step investigates how the natural experiment affects the probability of programme participation. The second step then considers this probability when evaluating the effect of the actual programme. …. Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens thus showed exactly what conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Their analysis is also relevant for randomised experiments where we do not have complete control over who participates in the intervention, which is the case in almost all field experiments. The framework developed by Angrist and Imbens has been widely adopted by researchers who work with observational data. By clarifying the assumptions necessary to establish a causal relationship, their framework has also increased the transparency – and thus credibility – of empirical research.”

	*A revolution in empirical research*

	“The Laureates’ contributions from the early 1990s demonstrate that it is possible to answer important questions about cause and effect using natural experiments. Their contributions complement and strengthen one another: Angrist and Imbens’ methodological insights about natural experiments and Card’s applications of this approach to important questions led the way for other researchers. We now have a coherent framework which, among other things, means that we know how the results of such studies should be interpreted. The work of the Laureates has revolutionised empirical research in the social sciences and significantly improved the ability of the research community to answer questions of great importance to us all.”

### Appendix 15.1. Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel dealing with econometry and some economic theories.

What follows is a list of those awarded prices mostly related to econometry and economic theories connected with one of the following five aspects: decisions, games, welfare, development, and natural experiments.  Each item in the list contains the year of the award, the names and dates of the laureates, and the reasons for such recognitions. Afterwards we insert the document called FACTS which is a brief explanation of the work developed by the laureates. We also mention the titles of the Prize Lectures presented by each laureate. Their references are all in MLA format and have been indicated in the Reference section.

**E1969:** Ragnar Frisch (1895-1969) and Jan Tinbergen (1903-1994)  “for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes”

“Ragnar Frisch, along with Jan Tinbergen, pioneered development of mathematical formulations of economics. He coined the term econometrics for studies in which he used statistical methods to describe economic systems. He is best known for his contributions to dynamic economic modeling, and in 1933 he presented the first mathematical economic model that could describe fluctuations in the business cycle. His later work concerned models for economic planning.”

“Ragnar Frisch before him, Jan Tinbergen was a pioneer in changing economics from a science formulated in words to one based on mathematics. During the 1930s he developed the first macroeconomic model that described in detail variables from the entire economy and placed them in a mathematical relationship with one another. Previously this could only be done in general terms, but now it could be done with concrete numbers. Tinbergen used his knowledge of statistics to test models in order to choose those that were most suitable.”

*From Utopian Theory to Practical Applications: The Case of Econometrics* by Frisch.

*The Use of Models: Experience and Prospects* by Tinbergen.

**E1970:** Paul A. Samuelson (1915-2009) "for the scientific work through which he has developed static and dynamic economic theory and actively contributed to raising the level of analysis in economic science"

“Where Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen had earlier focused on statistics and empirical data, Paul Samuelson devoted his time to theoretical methods and analysis of economics. He formalized economics research using mathematics and his work influences practically all branches of modern economics. He saw himself as the last generalist among increasingly specialized economists and was one of the foremost innovators in the New Keynesian school, which incorporated Keynes' ideas with market theories.”

*Maximum Principles in Analytical Economics* by Samuelson.

**E1973:** Wassily Leontief (1906-1999) “for the development of the input-output method and for its application to important economic problems”

“Wassily Leontief created the input-output analysis, which describes the interdependence in the production system as a network of deliveries between the various sectors of production. The method provided tools for a systematic analysis of the complicated interindustrial transactions in an economy. Leontieff is also distinguished for having developed linear programming, a mathematical technique for solving complex problems of economic operations.”

*Structure of the World Economy* by Leontief.

**E1978:** Herbert A. Simon (1916-2001) “for his pioneering research into the decision-making process within economic organizations”

“Herbert Simon combined different scientific disciplines and considered new factors in economic theories. Established economic theories held that enterprises and entrepreneurs all acted in completely rational ways, with the maximization of their own profit as their only goal. In contrast, Simon held that when making choices all people deviate from the strictly rational, and described companies as adaptable systems, with physical, personal, and social components. Through these perspectives, he was able to write about decision-making processes in modern society in an entirely new way.”

*Rational Decision-Making in Business Organizations* by Simon.

**E1979:** Theodore W. Schultz (1902-1998) and Sir Arthur Lewis (1815-1991) “for their pioneering research into economic development research with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries”

“The main characteristic of Theodore Schultz’s studies is that he treated agricultural economy as an integral part of the entire economy. His analytical interest was focused on the imbalance between relative poverty and underdevelopment in agriculture compared with the higher productivity and higher income levels in industry and other urban economic activities.”

“Arthur Lewis was a leading figure and pioneer in the field of economic development. Lewis created two theoretical explanatory models designed to describe and explain the intrinsic problems of underdevelopment. The first model is based on the dual nature of a developing economy. Lewis’s other basic models relates to the determination of the terms of trade between developing and developed countries.”

*The Economics of Being Poor* by Schultz

*The Slowing Down of the Engine of Growth* by Lewis.

**E1981:** James Tobin  (1918-2002) “for his analysis of financial markets and their relations to expenditure decisions, employment, production and prices”.

“James Tobin’s achievements cover a broad spectrum of economic research. He made substantial contributions in such widely differing areas as econometric methods and strictly formalized game theory, the theory of household and firm behavior, general macro theory and applied analysis of economic policy. His most outstanding and significant research contribution belongs to the theory of financial markets and their relation to consumption and investment decisions, production, employment and prices.”

*Money and Finance in the Macro-Economic Process* by Tobin.

**E1983:** Gerard Debreu (1921-2004) “for having incorporated new analytical methods into economic theory and for his rigorous reformulation of the theory of general equilibrium”.

“Debreu’s classic monograph, The Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium, was published in 1959. In it, Debreu provided the mathematical underpinnings for the phenomenon of equilibrium in supply and demand. Debreu also made significant contributions to the theory of consumer behavior.”

*Economic Theory in the Mathematical Mode* by Debreu.


**E1989:** Trygve Haavelmo (1911-1999) “for his clarification of the probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of simultaneous economic structures”.

“Trygve Haavelmo was a pioneer in what became the field of economic forecasting. His statistical techniques made possible the development of econometric models that predict how a change in one aspect of the economy will affect others; that is, he demonstrated that statistical probability theory could be integrated into economic formulations. Haavelmo’s method contributed to the techniques of national economic forecasting.”

*Econometrics and the Welfare State* by Haavelmo.

**E1994:** John C. Harsanyi (1920-2000), John F. Nash Jr. (1928-2015) and Reinhard Selten (1930-2016) “for their pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games”

“John C. Harsanyi was awarded the Economic Sciences Prize in for his work in game theory and its application to economics. He showed how games of incomplete information can be analyzed thereby providing a theoretical foundation for a lively field of research – the economics of information. He is also known for researching utilitarian ethics and is considered one of the most important exponents of the “rule utilitarianism”.”

“John F. Nash is the only person who has been awarded both the Economic Sciences Prize and the Abel Prize. He received the Economic Sciences Prize for his work in game theory, more specifically the Nash equilibrium theory. He introduced the distinction between cooperative games and non-cooperative games. He also did ground breaking work in other mathematics and developed the Nash embedding theorem.”

“Reinhard Selten received the Economic Sciences Prize for his work in game theory, along with his co recipients John F. Nash Jr and John C. Harsanyi. He refined the Nash equilibrium concept for analyzing dynamic strategic interaction by getting rid of unlikely equilibria. He also applied the refined concept to analyses of oligopolistic competition. He is also well known for his work in bounded rationality. He also built the BonnEconLab at the University of Bonn.”

*Games with Incomplete Information* by Harsanyi.

*The Work of John Nash in Game Theory* by Nash.

*Multistage Game Models and Delay Supergames* by Selten.

**E1998:** Amartya Sen (1933) “for his contributions to welfare economics”.

“Which are the most important and fundamental resources in a community and how should we divide them? One focus of Amartya Sen's research is how individuals' values can be considered in collective decision-making and how welfare and poverty can be measured. His efforts stem from his interest in questions of distribution and, in particular, the lot of society's poorest members. Sen's studies have included famines, to create a deeper understanding of the economic reasons behind famine and poverty.”

*The Possibility of Social Choice* by Sen.


**E2002:** Daniel Kahneman (1934) “for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty” and Vernon L. Smith (1927) “for having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms”

“Daniel Kahneman began his prize-awarded research in the late 1960s. In order to increase understanding of how people make economic decisions, he drew on cognitive psychology in relation to the mental process used in forming judgements and making choices. His research on decision-making under uncertainty resulted in the formulation of a new branch of economics, prospect theory.”

“Vernon Smith has laid the foundation for the field of experimental economics. He has developed an array of experimental methods, setting standards for what constitutes a reliable laboratory experiment in economics. In his own experimental work, he has demonstrated the importance of alternative market institutions, e.g., how the revenue expected by a seller depends on the choice of auction method.”

*Maps of Bounded Rationality* by Kahneman.

*Constructivist and Ecological Rationality in Economics* by Smith..

**E2005:** Robert J. Aumann (1930) and Thomas C. Schelling (1921-2016) “for having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis”.

“Aumann was awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences for his theory of repeated games, which enhances our understanding of the prerequisites for cooperation. Insights into these issues help explain economic conflicts, such as price wars and trade wars. He was educated at MIT in Boston, where he received his Ph. D. in 1955. After moving to Israel in 1956, he was a member of the mathematics faculty at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.”

“Thomas Schelling specialized in the application of game theory to cases in which adversaries must repeatedly interact, especially in international trade, treaties and conflicts. His work prompted new developments in game theory and accelerated its use and application throughout the social sciences. Schelling’s analysis of strategic commitments has explained a wide range of phenomena, from the competitive strategies of firms to the delegation of political decision power.”

*War and Peace* by Aumann.

*An Astonishing Sixty Years: The Legacy of Hiroshima* by Schelling.

**E2017:** Richard H. Thaler (1945) “for his contributions to behavioural economics”.

“How do human traits govern individual economic decisions and what effect do they have on markets as a whole? Since the 1980s, Richard Thaler has analyzed economic decision-making with the aid of insights from psychology. He has paid special attention to three psychological factors: the tendency to not behave completely rationally, notions of fairness and reasonableness, and lack of self-control. His findings have had a profound influence on many areas of economic research and policy.”

*From Cashews to Nudges: The Evolution of Behavioral Economics* by Thaler.

**E2019:** Abhijit Banerjee (1961), Esther Duflo (1972) and Michael Kremer (1964) “for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”.

“One of humanity’s most urgent issues is the reduction of global poverty, in all its forms. Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer have introduced a new approach to obtaining reliable answers about the best ways to fight global poverty. It involves dividing this issue into smaller, more manageable, questions. Since the mid-1990s, they have been able to test a range of interventions in different areas using field experiments, for example for improving educational outcomes or child health.”

*Field Experiments and the Practice of Economics* by Banerjee.

*Field Experiments and the Practice of Policy* by Duflo.

*Experimentation, Innovation, and Economics* by Kremer.

**E2021:** David Card (1956) “for his empirical contributions to labour economics” and Joshua D. Angrist (1960) and Guido W. Imbens  (1963) “for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships”.

“Many of the big questions in the social sciences deal with cause and effect. Some of these questions are possible to answer using natural experiments, in which chance events or policy changes result in groups of people being treated differently. Using natural experiments, David Card has analysed the labour market effects of minimum wages, immigration and education. The results showed, among other things, that increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs, as was previously thought.”

“Many of the big questions in the social sciences deal with cause and effect. Some of these questions are possible to answer using natural experiments, in which chance events or policy changes result in groups of people being treated differently. In 1994, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens showed what conclusions about causation can be drawn from natural experiments in which people cannot be either forced or forbidden to participate in the programme being studied.”
