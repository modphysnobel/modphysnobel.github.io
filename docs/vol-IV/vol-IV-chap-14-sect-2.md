Again, as in previous section, PNP means Physics Nobel Prize.

**PNP1995:** awarded "for pioneering experimental contributions to lepton physics" jointly with one half to Martin L. Perl "for the discovery of the tau lepton" and with one half to Frederick Reines "for the detection of the neutrino". We focus only on Reines.

	WORK (Reines): “During the beta decay of a nucleus, a neutron is converted to a proton and an electron is produced. In studying the electron’s velocity, it was clear that this decay violated energy-conversation and other laws. It was thus proposed that an additional particle—a neutrino—was formed during beta decay. In the early 1950s, Frederick Reines passed radiation from a nuclear reactor through a water tank and discovered reactions that proved the neutrino’s existence.”

	- In 1930 Wolfgang Pauli was analyzing a nuclear beta decay process in which an atomic nucleus emitted an electron; however, something else was missing to balance energy. To make sure that energy was conserved he proposed the existence of a hypothetical subatomic particle without electrical charge, a negligible mass and it reacted very little with its environment: the neutrino was not observed, but it carried the missing energy.

	- In 1933 Enrico Fermi was working on a theory for explaining the weak force and called neutrino (little neutral one in Italian) to the particle proposed by Pauli. Fermi also used the neutrino hypothesis to formulate a theory for weak interactions and considered that nuclear reactors could be used as intensive neutrino sources.

	- In 1953 Frederick Reines and Clyde L. Cowan, Jr., proposed a reactor experiment to detect neutrinos and demonstrated experimentally its existence. They passed a radiation coming from a nuclear reactor through 200 liters of a solution of cadmium chloride ($CdCl_2$) in water. They studied a reaction where a neutrino was captured by a proton giving a neutron and a positron. The neutrino quickly faded away. The positron was slowed down by the water and annihilated by an electron. This annihilation created two photons, which were registered in two scintillation detectors. The neutron slowed down in the water and was eventually captured by a cadmium nucleus which are strong neutron absorbers. 

	- In 1956 Reines and Cowan sent a telegram to Pauli announcing that they have discovered reactions that proved the existence of neutrino, the subatomic particle that he invented thirty years ago.

**PNP2002:** divided, one half jointly to Raymond Davis Jr. and Masatoshi Koshiba "for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos" and the other half to Riccardo Giacconi "for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources".

	WORK (Davis): “In certain nuclear reactions (such as when protons combine to form helium nuclei) elusive particles called neutrinos are created. Raymond Davies wanted to detect neutrinos in radiation from space to confirm the theory that this kind of nuclear reaction is the source of the sun’s energy. Beginning in the 1960s, he placed a large tank containing a chlorine-rich liquid inside a mine. In rare cases, a neutrino interacted with a chlorine atom to form an argon atom. By counting these argon atoms, neutrinos from space could be detected.”

	WORK (Koshiba): “Certain nuclear reactions, including those where hydrogen atoms combine with helium, form elusive particles called neutrinos. By proving the existence of neutrinos in cosmic radiation, Raymond Davis showed that the sun's energy originates from such nuclear reactions. From 1980, Masatoshi Koshiba provided further proof of this through measurements taken inside an enormous water tank within a mine. In rare cases, neutrinos react with atomic nuclei in water, creating an electron and thus a flash of light that can be detected.”

	- A radioactive beta decay is a three-body process in which an atomic nucleus emits an electron and another subatomic particle which is created in the interaction process. In a beta decay of a neutron it is transformed into a proton by the emission of an electron accompanied by an antineutrino. Conversely, a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron with a neutrino in the so-called positron emission. These transformations between neutrons and protons corresponds to exchanges of the quantum bosons of the weak force carriers: the particles named as $W^+$, $W^-$ and $Z^0$.  

	- In 1962 León Lederman, Melvin Schwartz y Jack Steinberger were able to distinguish electron and muon decay reactions in which two types of neutrinos were produced, later called electron neutrino ($ν_e$) and muon neutrino ($ν_μ$).

	- In 1960 Raymond Davis Jr constructed a neutrino detector placed in a mine. Over a period of 30 years, he succeeded in capturing a total of 2,000 neutrinos from the Sun and was thus able to prove that fusion provided the energy from the Sun. Since 1987 Masatoshi Koshiba have been working on another gigantic detector called Kamiokande with which he confirmed the results obtained by Davis and in 1987 detected a burst of neutrinos from a supernova explosion produced as far away as 170,000 light years from Earth (like 170 $\times 10^{16}$ km).

	- The works of Davis and Koshiba have led to a new field of research, neutrino astronomy, where the intensities of high energy neutrinos are estimated from  astrophysical sources such as neutron stars, pulsars, binary systems, active galactic nuclei, and supernovae, as well as blazars (objects which emit energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and are characterized by a variability which scales from long to short periods).

	WORK (Giacconi): “Stars and galaxies emit not only visible light, but also X-rays. However, the X-rays dissipate as they pass through the earth’s atmosphere, so X-rays from the cosmos have to be studied by means of telescopes in satellites. Beginning in the 1960s, Riccardo Giacconi made several pivotal contributions to the development of such telescopes. With the telescopes, he discovered X-ray sources outside our own solar system, cosmic background radiation with X-ray wavelengths as well as X-ray sources that probably contain black holes”.

!!! info "PHYSICS CONTENT (based on *Press release* and *Popular information*)."

	- As X-ray radiation is almost entirely absorbed by the air in the Earth’s thick atmosphere it was not until the 1940s that rockets had been developed to transport detection and measurement instruments. In 1959 Riccardo Giacconi formed a group for carrying out rocket experiments to try to prove the presence of X-ray radiation from the universe. 

	- In 1962 he was the first to record a source of X-rays outside the solar system. In 1970 a satellite was launched to survey the sky for X-ray radiation and in 1978 a high-definition X-ray telescope had been sent into space (this is nowadays known as Einstein X-ray Observatory). An improved and larger X-ray observatory called Chandra was launched in 1999.

**PNP2015:** awarded jointly to Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald "for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass".

!!! tip "Physics Nobel Prize."

	WORK (Kajita): “The Standard Model used by modern physics has three types of a very small and elusive particle called the neutrino. In the Super-Kamiokande detector, an experimental facility in a mine in Japan in 1998, Takaaki Kajita detected neutrinos created in reactions between cosmic rays and the Earth’s atmosphere. Measurements showed deviations, which were explained by the neutrinos switching between the different types. This means that they must have mass. The Standard Model, however, is based on neutrinos lacking mass and the model must be revised.”

	WORK (McDonald): “The Standard Model used by modern physics has three types of a very small and elusive particle called the neutrino. In an experimental facility in a mine in Canada in 2000, Arthur McDonald studied neutrinos created in nuclear reactions in the sun. Measurements showed deviations, which were explained by the neutrinos switching between the different types. This means that they must have mass. The Standard Model, however, is based on neutrinos lacking mass and the model must be revised.”

	- In 1930 Wolfgang Pauli proposed the existence of an extra particle to satisfy the conservation of energy in the beta disintegration of a neutron into a proton and an electron. Later, such extra particle was named neutrino by Fermi.

	- In 1974 Martin Perl and collaborators discovered the tau ($τ$) particle and assumed the existence of the tau neutrino ($ν_τ$). The existence of a triplet of neutrinos is because a neutrino collides with an atomic nucleus and an electron, a muon or a tauon is produced, then neutrinos of the electronic, muonic or tauonic type are generated.

	- The mechanisms of neutrino production are multiple: reactions of cosmic radiation in the Earth's atmosphere, radioactive decay, reactions in nuclear plants, supernova explosions, death of massive stars, or production of nuclear reactions in the interior of the Sun. Most neutrinos that reach Earth come from the latter mechanism and are of the electron neutrino type. This is due to a fusion process in which helium is obtained from hydrogen, producing two neutrinos for each helium nucleus.

	- If only electron neutrinos are released from the Sun and it turns out that a smaller number reach the Earth than calculated, it is possible that in that trip of 150 million kilometers some electron neutrinos will be lost; that is, they are transformed into other types of neutrinos that are no longer detected. The first results indicated differences of the order of 34% and in subsequent experiments these differences reached up to 66%. This means that neutrinos change their identity when traveling. The possibility of this transformation in neutrino identity was predicted by Bruno Pontecorvo in 1957 and constitutes what is called neutrino oscillation.  

	- Two sets of experiments have been conclusive in detecting neutrino oscillations: the experiments started in 1986 at the SuperKamiokande detector in Japan to record changes in neutrinos generated in the atmosphere and those started a few years later at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada to detect neutrinos coming from the Sun. With some differences in details, both experiments were carried out in mines about a thousand meters below the Earth where tanks with 50,000 tons of heavy water and of the order of ten thousand to eleven thousand light detectors were installed on the interior walls, base, and cover of the tank. The first Japanese results on the existence of neutrino oscillations were reported in 1996 while the Canadian results were published in 2001.

	- After crossing the earth's surface the neutrinos reach the tank and interact with the water molecules, then charged particles (electrons or muons) are produced, which in turn generate radiation that is registered in the light detectors. These signals are then amplified, recorded, and accounted for. The shape and intensity of the generated radiation indicated the type of neutrino and from where it came from. The conclusion in both experiments was the same: neutrinos present oscillations indicating that at least one of the neutrinos in the triplet has mass, which contradicts what is predicted by the Standard Model that assumes that neutrinos lack mass.

	- The two experiments confirmed the suspicion that neutrinos can change from one identity to another. We have here a problem of interpretation that might be explained in quantum terms: the electron-neutrino, muon-neutrino and tau-neutrinos are represented by superposed waves that correspond to neutrino states with different masses. The superposition in any given location yields the probability for what type of neutrino is most likely to be found there. The probabilities vary from one location to another, they oscillate, and the neutrinos appear in their various identities having different masses. When the waves are in phase it is not possible to distinguish the different neutrino states from each other; when neutrinos travel through space the waves go out of phase and along the way the waves are superposed in varying ways. This is a quantum metamorphosis process.

**PNP1978:** divided, one half awarded to Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa "for his basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics", the other half jointly to Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson "for their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation". We focus only on Penzias and Wilson.

!!! tip "Physics Nobel Prize."

	WORK (Penzias and Wilson): “Radiation falls toward the earth from outer space. This cosmic radiation initially appeared to become weaker as wavelengths of the radiation became shorter. However, when Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson studied cosmic radiation in 1964, they discovered that microwaves with a wavelength of about 7 centimeters were stronger than expected. At first they thought that the results were caused by distortions or faults in the measurements, but that was not the case. This cosmic background radiation probably is a remnant of the Big Bang when the universe was created.”

!!! info "PHYSICS CONTENT (based on *Speed read* and *Press release*)."

	- In the 1940s there have been attempts for explaining how and when the synthesis of chemical elements was accomplished. Ralph Alpher, Hans Bethe and George Gamow published a paper untitled *The Origin of Chemical Elements*. Also, Robert Dicke did search for evidence to support the theory that the universe was created from a single, highly explosive moment: the Big Bang.  He predicted that such event should leave a faint, cold afterglow that could be detected, as a reminder of the moment, 15 billion years ago, when the hot and rapidly expanding universe began to cool down. 

	- In the early 1960s, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were working at Bell Telephone Laboratories with very sensitive radio wave receivers for use in satellite communications. Surprisingly, they found waves of great intensity at microwave frequencies in the range between 1GHz and 300 GHz, which corresponds to wavelengths between 30 centimeters and 1 millimeter. At the beginning they suspected that this radiation must originate either in the instrument or in the atmosphere; however, they showed that it came from outer space and that its intensity was the same in all directions. Furthermore, the detected cosmic microwave background radiation was emitted at a temperature of 3 degrees above absolute zero.

**PNP2006:** awarded jointly to John C. Mather and George F. Smoot "for their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation".

!!! tip "Physics Nobel Prize."

	WORK (Mather): “Various types of particles and radiation travel through outer space, including cosmic background radiation, which has been carefully studied through measurements from the COBE satellite. John Mather, a driving force in the project, had particular responsibility for a part that in 1989 indicated that cosmic background radiation’s spectrum corresponds to black-body radiation—radiation emitted by a dark, glowing body. The result provided evidence that the background radiation is a remnant from the creation of the universe in the Big Bang.”

	WORK (Smoot): “Various types of particles and radiation travel through outer space, including cosmic background radiation, which has been carefully studied through measurements from the COBE satellite. George Smoot led a project that in 1992 was able to point out small variations in radiation in different directions. This provides a clue to how stars and other heavenly bodies have come into existence. The variations can be explained by a kind of quantum mechanical fluctuations that have caused matter in certain places to form clumps that then have grown because of gravitation."

	- The first measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation were made from high mountain summits, rocket probes and balloons. However, as the Earth’s atmosphere absorbs much of these radiations, the measurements need to be carried out at great altitude; furthermore, earthbound instruments cannot easily investigate all directions of the Universe. To overcome these obstacles, in 1974 the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) issued an invitation to submit proposals for new space-based experiments oriented to investigate the blackbody spectrum of the microwave background radiation.

	- In 1989 the COsmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite was launched to study cosmic microwave background radiation from orbit, involving a collaboration of nearly 1000 scientists, engineers, and others. John Mather was the main responsible of the entire project and George Smoot was to look for small variations of the radiation in different directions. 

	- The reported measurements made on the COBE satellite corresponded to a perfect blackbody spectrum whose shape depended only on the temperature of the emitting body, exactly as the spectrum studied by Max Planck in 1918. COBE had in place three types of instruments: DIRBE (Diffuse InfraRed Background Experiment), DMR (Differential Microwave Radiometer) and FIRAS (Far InfraRed Absolute Spectrophotometer). 

	- The registered wavelengths of the microwave background were in the millimeter range and corresponded to a temperature of 2.725 K above absolute zero. Such measurements determined temperature fluctuations up to a precision of $10^{-5}$. These tiny variations in temperature could show where matter had started aggregating according to an anisotropic distribution of matter in the universe that might be attributed to quantum fluctuations and involving dark matter.

**PNP2011:** divided, one half awarded to Saul Perlmutter, the other half jointly to Brian P. Schmidt and Adam G. Riess "for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae".

!!! tip "Physics Nobel Prize."

	WORK (Perlmutter, Schmidt, and Riess): “The universe’s stars and galaxies are moving away from one another; the universe is expanding. Up until recently, the majority of astrophysicists believed that this expansion would eventually wane, due to the effect of opposing gravitational forces. Saul Perlmutter, Brian Schmidt, and Adam Riess studied exploding stars, called supernovae. Because the light emitted by stars appears weaker from a larger distance and takes on a reddish hue as it moves further from the observer, the researchers were able to determine how the supernovae moved. In 1998 they reached a surprising result: the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.”

!!! info "PHYSICS CONTENT (based on *Presse release* and *Popular information*)."

	For almost a century, the Universe has been known to be expanding because of the great explosion called Big Bang, about 13.8 $\times 10^9$ years ago. 

	- In 1908 Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868-1921) formulated the period-luminosity relation linking the luminosity of pulsating variable stars with their pulsation period. This relation has served as a cosmic benchmarks for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances.  

	- In 1917 Albert Einstein (1879-1955) introduced a term called the cosmological constant to counterbalance the effect of gravity to obtain a static universe as a solution of his general relativity equations. So in order to stop the unwanted cosmic expansion, he added a constant term to his equations, the cosmological constant, which had the effect of a repulsive force against the gravitational attraction of matter.

	- In 1927 Georges Lemaitre (1894-1966) proposed a theory explaining the expansion of the universe, even indicating that such expansion was accelerated. In 1929 he published a paper untitled *Un Univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extragalactiques. (A homogeneous Universe of constant mass and growing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extragalactic nebulae).*

	- In 1998 two radio astronomy teams report observations of supernovae Ia indicating that the universe was expanding rapidly: the Supernova Cosmology Project that began work in 1988 led by Saul Perlmutter and the High-z Supernova Search Team that began in 1994, led by Brian Schmidt with the collaboration of Adam Riess. These research teams were working to trace a map the Universe by locating the most distant supernovae.

	- These two research teams reported the detection of signals from explosions of a certain type of supernovae, the so-called Supernovae Ia, which was the product of the explosion of a binary system of white dwarf stars. In a system of two stars, when the lower-mass star begins to take mass away from the other star and reaches a limit value of 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, the system becomes unstable, and an observable thermonuclear explosion occurs.

	- The supernova Ia was as heavy as the Sun but as small as the Earth; it emitted as much light as an entire galaxy.  In a typical galaxy only one or two supernova explosions occur in a thousand years. Nevertheless, in September 2011, one such supernova was observed in a galaxy close to the Big Dipp.

	- The two research teams of astronomers found over 50 distant supernovae whose light was weaker than expected. The dimmer its light, the farther away the star. They just wanted to locate distant stars and to measure how they move. They expected to find signs that the expansion of the Universe was slowing down. What they found was the opposite: the galaxies were rushing away from us and each other, and the farther away they were, the faster they moved. This was a sign that the expansion of the Universe was accelerating. 

	- Today, the cosmological constant instead appears to make the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. This increase in the expansion speed could be caused by the push produced by the dark energy that covers the entire universe by an estimated 70%.

**PNP2019:** awarded "for contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth’s place in the cosmos" with one half to James Peebles "for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology", the other half jointly to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz "for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star".

	WORK (Peebles): “Fundamental questions about the universe’s structure and history have always fascinated human beings. James Peebles’ theoretical framework, developed since the mid-1960s, is the basis of our contemporary ideas about the universe. The cosmic background radiation is a remaining trace of the formation of the universe. Using his theoretical tools and calculations, James Peebles was able to interpret these traces from the infancy of the universe and discover new physical processes. The results showed us a universe in which just five per cent of its content is known matter. The rest, 95 per cent, is unknown dark matter and dark energy.”

	- Since the mid-1960s James Peebles has contributed to the development of cosmology. He considered that the traces left by the Big Bang explosion at the beginning of the universe, the cosmic microwave background radiation, were essential in the formation of stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. He explained that the radiation’s temperature could provide information about the quantity of matter created at the Big Bang explosion. 

	- Furthermore, Peebles introduced the concept of cold dark matter and reinterpreted the Albert Einstein’s cosmological constant which is the energy of empty space also known as dark energy.

	WORK (Mayor and Queloz): “Fundamental questions about the universe’s structure and history have always fascinated human beings. In 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz announced the first discovery of a planet outside our solar system, an exoplanet, orbiting a solar-type star in our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Using custom-made instruments, they were able to see planet 51 Pegasi b, in the Pegasus constellation. Since then over 4,000 exoplanets have been found in the Milky Way. Eventually, we may find an answer to the eternal question of whether other life is out there.”

	- In October 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz announced the first discovery of a planet outside our solar system, an exoplanet. They were able to see planet 51 Pegasi b which is 50 light years from the Earth. It is a gaseous ball comparable with the solar system’s biggest gas giant, Jupiter.

	- Planets orbiting other stars cannot be directly observed, since the light they emit is too faint. Instead, it is the motion of the planet around the star that must be observed. The star moves as it is affected by the gravity of its planet. A Pegasi year takes just over four days, compared to Earth’s one year and Jupiter’s 12 years. 

	- To measure the movement of the planet orbiting the star Mayor and Queloz built a special instrument − a spectrograph. They measured the radial velocity of the star by means of the Doppler effect: light rays from an object moving towards us are bluer and, if the object is moving away from us, the rays are redder. These Doppler shifts gave information about the planet’s orbital period around the star and also set a lower mass limit.
