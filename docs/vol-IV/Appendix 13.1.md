Appendix 13.1. References to Nobel Prizes and Lectures in Physics and Chemistry.

In this Appendix we identify each Nobel Prize with the shorthand of the discipline (Ph for Physics or Ch for Chemistry) and the year of the award. Afterwards, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize, we indicate to whom and for what reasons each Prize has been awarded. We also include the title of the corresponding Nobel Lecture and its subtitles when they exist in the original. All the references are indicated in the MLA style.
