## 15. Universes composed by humans and societies.

!!! abstract "Introduction"

	*What kind of universe is described by some Prizes in Economic Sciences?*

	Is it worthwhile to talk about universes in Economic Sciences? What can we learn from the descriptions of the Sveriges Riksbank Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel? 

	Several mathematical ideas and procedures as well as physical concepts and models have been used and adapted to study social processes from a perspective based in Economic sciences. Furthermore, many economists have been former mathematicians and some of them studied Physics.

	**Learning objectives of Chapter 15.**
 	
	After this Chapter you should be able to: 

	- Analyze the meaning of Economic Sciences and describe a selection of Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel awarded since 1969 up to 2023.
	- Describe the Prize in Economic Sciences awarded in 1969 recognizing the development of dynamic models in econometry. 
	- Describe the Prize in Economic Sciences awarded in 2021 recognizing the analysis of causal relationships in the study of natural experiments. 

!!! abstract "Description of content of Chapter 15."

	**Section 15.1. Selection of Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.**
	
	This section describes a selection of 15 of the 54 Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel awarded since 1969 up to 2023. This selection only considers research in econometry and some applications of economic theories.

	**Section 15.2. Role of statistical analysis in the formulation of models.**

	This section deals with the description of the first Prize in Economic Sciences awarded in 1969 to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen “for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes”.

	**Section 15.3. Interpretation of natural experiments in Economic sciences.**

	This section concerns the description of one of the last Prizes in Economic Sciences awarded in 2021 to David Card “for his empirical contributions to labour economics” and to Joshua D. Angrist and Guido W. Imbens “for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships”. We will not deal with Card´s recognized works.


## 15.1. Selection of Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.


Sciences are rational systems for explaining certain objects and phenomena. Sciences are not dry knowledge; they are embedded in social contexts. Natural sciences and social sciences look for describing and understanding structural properties and functional behaviors of diverse universes. They have distinct levels and degrees of development because they address different kinds of problems; they create, apply, and test their own concepts, models, and research methodologies. The universe of humans and societies is different from the universe of atoms, molecules, galaxies, and black holes.

Alfred Nobel signed his will on November 27, 1895, and he died on December 10, 1896. It was till December 10, 1901, that the first Nobel Prizes were awarded in Physics, Chemistry, and Physiology or Medicine, as well as in Literature and Peace. N0 place for Mathematics neither for Social Sciences. Nevertheless, in 1968, the Sveriges Riksbank established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Understanding recognized research works in Economic Science compensate the original decision made by Alfred Nobel.

The word Economy comes from two Greek roots: οικος - house, in the sense of patrimony and νέμεωιν - to administrate or to manage. Then, the original meaning of the word was household management. Nowadays this meaning has been extended and refers to the production, distribution, exchange and consumption of goods, resources and services, according to arrangements and modes of operation of specific social systems.

Economic Science is a branch of social sciences where societies and human relationships are studied. There are two main methods for approaching social sciences: the positivist one that resembles natural sciences and tries to construct empirically falsifiable theories, and the interpretative or speculative one that applies social critiques or symbolic interpretations. These methods apply the following research design types to different kind of objects of study: the quantitative design looks for quantitative evidence, apply statistical analysis and create valid and reliable general claims, and the qualitative design is based on direct observation and communication with participants, and tries to achieve contextual and subjective accuracy over generality.

Economy has been historically developed through three main phases or degrees: in ancient times, it was based on subsistence farming; then, because of the industrial revolution, it was mostly dependent on mining, construction and manufacturing industries, as well as in commerce; and in modern times, where consumer societies have been characterized by technological developments and commercial arrangements.

Usually, Economy is divided into Microeconomics (the study of the behavior of the individual consumers and businesses that make up the economy) and Macroeconomics (the study of the overall performance of an economy). Microeconomics deals with its basic elements like economic agents (individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments), firms and markets, and operations like production, exchange, and consumption. Macroeconomics refers to  the structure, performance, behavior, and decision-making of the whole system in connection with phenomena such as inflation, price levels, rate of economic growth, national income, gross domestic product, inflation, balance of trade, changes in unemployment, ….

To have an idea of how broad is the discipline of Economic Sciences it is important to consider the classification of publication categories in the  Journal of Economic Literature (JEL), according to the American Economic Association (AEA). The following list has been obtained from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEL_classification_codes>.

•	General Economics and Teaching; 

•	History of Economic Thought;

•	Economic methodology and Heterodox Approaches;

•	Mathematical and Quantitative Methods;

•	Microeconomics;

•	Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics;

•	International Economics;

•	Financial Economics, Public Economics; 

•	Health, Education, and Welfare;

•	Labor Economics and Demographic Economics;

•	Law and Economics;

•	Business Administration and Business Economics;

•	Marketing, Accounting, Personnel Economics;

•	Economic History;

•	Economic Development, Innovation, Innovation, Technological Change and Growth;

•	Economic Systems; 

•	Agriculture and Natural Resource Economics; 

•	Environmental and Ecological Economics; Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics, and

Up to now, 54 Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel have been awarded in the period 1969-2023. In this Chapter 15 we select those Prizes in Economic Science associated to econometry, as the application of principles of mathematical analysis to economic problems, and to economic theories related to decisions, games, welfare, development, and social experiments. In what follows, for each one of the selected Prizes, we indicate the year of the award, the names of the laureates and the reasons for the recognized research.  More details of these Prizes are given in Appendix 15.1.  

In 1969 it was awarded jointly to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen "for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes".

In 1970 it was awarded to Paul A. Samuelson "for the scientific work through which he has developed static and dynamic economic theory and actively contributed to raising the level of analysis in economic science".

In 1973 it was awarded to Wassily Leontief "for the development of the input-output method and for its application to important economic problems".

In 1978 it was awarded to Herbert A. Simon "for his pioneering research into the decision-making process within economic organizations".

In 1979 it was awarded jointly to Theodore W. Schultz and Sir Arthur Lewis "for their pioneering research into economic development research with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries".

In 1981 it was awarded to James Tobin "for his analysis of financial markets and their relations to expenditure decisions, employment, production and prices".

In 1983 it was awarded to Gerard Debreu "for having incorporated new analytical methods into economic theory and for his rigorous reformulation of the theory of general equilibrium".

In 1989 it was awarded to Trygve Haavelmo "for his clarification of the probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of simultaneous economic structures".

In 1994 it was awarded jointly to John C. Harsanyi, John F. Nash Jr. and Reinhard Selten "for their pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games".

In 1998 it was awarded to Amartya Sen "for his contributions to welfare economics".

In 2002 it was divided equally between Daniel Kahneman "for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty" and Vernon L. Smith "for having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms".

In 2005 it was awarded jointly to Robert J. Aumann and Thomas C. Schelling "for having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis".

In 2017 it was awarded to Richard H. Thaler "for his contributions to behavioural economics".

In 2019 it was awarded jointly to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer "for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty".

In 2021 it was divided, one half awarded to David Card "for his empirical contributions to labour economics", the other half jointly to Joshua D. Angrist and Guido W. Imbens "for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships".
