## 15. Universes composed by humans and societies.

Sciences are rational systems for explaining certain objects and phenomena. Sciences are not dry knowledge; they are embedded in social contexts. Natural sciences and social sciences look for describing and understanding structural properties and functional behaviors of diverse universes. They have distinct levels and degrees of development because they address different kinds of problems; they create, apply, and test their own concepts, models, and research methodologies. The universe of humans and societies is different from the universe of atoms and molecules.

Alfred Nobel signed his will on November 27, 1895, and he died on December 10, 1896. It was till December 10, 1901, that the first Nobel Prizes were awarded in Physics, Chemistry, and Physiology or Medicine, as well as in Literature and Peace. N0 place for Mathematics neither for Social Sciences. Nevertheless, in 1968, the Sveriges Riksbank established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. 

Understanding recognized research works in Economic Science serves to illustrate how a social science such as Economics differs or resemble a natural science such as Physics. It is important to stress that many economists have been former mathematicians and that some of them studied Physics.

Section 15.1 considers a selection of 15 of the 54 Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel awarded since 1969 up to 2023. We only deal with those prizes awarded in 1969, 1970, 1973, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1989, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2017. 2019, and 2021. This selection refers to econometry and applications of economic theories related to decisions, games, welfare, development, and experiments. 

Next two Sections are dedicated to the first Prize in Economic Sciences awarded in 1969 (Section 15.2) and to one of the most recent Prizes awarded in 2021 (Section 15.3). Both awarded investigations show how mathematical ideas and procedures as well as physical concepts and models have been used and adapted in the study of some social processes.  

## 15.1. Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel dealing with econometry and some economic theories.

What follows is a list of those awarded prices mostly related to econometry and economic theories connected with one of the following five aspects: decisions, games, welfare, development, and experiments.  Each item in the list contains the year of the award, the names and dates of the laureates, and the reasons for such recognitions. Afterwards we insert the document called FACTS which is a brief explanation of the work developed by the laureates and we indicate the titles of the Prize Lectures presented by each laureate. Their references are given at the end of the chapter.

**E1969:** Ragnar Frisch (1895-1969) and Jan Tinbergen (1903-1994)  “for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes”

“Ragnar Frisch, along with Jan Tinbergen, pioneered development of mathematical formulations of economics. He coined the term econometrics for studies in which he used statistical methods to describe economic systems. He is best known for his contributions to dynamic economic modeling, and in 1933 he presented the first mathematical economic model that could describe fluctuations in the business cycle. His later work concerned models for economic planning.”

“Ragnar Frisch before him, Jan Tinbergen was a pioneer in changing economics from a science formulated in words to one based on mathematics. During the 1930s he developed the first macroeconomic model that described in detail variables from the entire economy and placed them in a mathematical relationship with one another. Previously this could only be done in general terms, but now it could be done with concrete numbers. Tinbergen used his knowledge of statistics to test models in order to choose those that were most suitable.”

*From Utopian Theory to Practical Applications: The Case of Econometrics* by Frisch.

*The Use of Models: Experience and Prospects* by Tinbergen.

**E1970:** Paul A. Samuelson (1915-2009) "for the scientific work through which he has developed static and dynamic economic theory and actively contributed to raising the level of analysis in economic science"

“Where Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen had earlier focused on statistics and empirical data, Paul Samuelson devoted his time to theoretical methods and analysis of economics. He formalized economics research using mathematics and his work influences practically all branches of modern economics. He saw himself as the last generalist among increasingly specialized economists and was one of the foremost innovators in the New Keynesian school, which incorporated Keynes' ideas with market theories.”

*Maximum Principles in Analytical Economics* by Samuelson.

**E1973:** Wassily Leontief (1906-1999) “for the development of the input-output method and for its application to important economic problems”

“Wassily Leontief created the input-output analysis, which describes the interdependence in the production system as a network of deliveries between the various sectors of production. The method provided tools for a systematic analysis of the complicated interindustrial transactions in an economy. Leontieff is also distinguished for having developed linear programming, a mathematical technique for solving complex problems of economic operations.”

*Structure of the World Economy* by Leontief.

**E1978:** Herbert A. Simon (1916-2001) “for his pioneering research into the decision-making process within economic organizations”

“Herbert Simon combined different scientific disciplines and considered new factors in economic theories. Established economic theories held that enterprises and entrepreneurs all acted in completely rational ways, with the maximization of their own profit as their only goal. In contrast, Simon held that when making choices all people deviate from the strictly rational, and described companies as adaptable systems, with physical, personal, and social components. Through these perspectives, he was able to write about decision-making processes in modern society in an entirely new way.”

*Rational Decision-Making in Business Organizations* by Simon.

**E1979:** Theodore W. Schultz (1902-1998) and Sir Arthur Lewis (1815-1991) “for their pioneering research into economic development research with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries”

“The main characteristic of Theodore Schultz’s studies is that he treated agricultural economy as an integral part of the entire economy. His analytical interest was focused on the imbalance between relative poverty and underdevelopment in agriculture compared with the higher productivity and higher income levels in industry and other urban economic activities.”

“Arthur Lewis was a leading figure and pioneer in the field of economic development. Lewis created two theoretical explanatory models designed to describe and explain the intrinsic problems of underdevelopment. The first model is based on the dual nature of a developing economy. Lewis’s other basic models relates to the determination of the terms of trade between developing and developed countries.”

*The Economics of Being Poor* by Schultz

*The Slowing Down of the Engine of Growth* by Lewis.

**E1981:** James Tobin  (1918-2002) “for his analysis of financial markets and their relations to expenditure decisions, employment, production and prices”.

“James Tobin’s achievements cover a broad spectrum of economic research. He made substantial contributions in such widely differing areas as econometric methods and strictly formalized game theory, the theory of household and firm behavior, general macro theory and applied analysis of economic policy. His most outstanding and significant research contribution belongs to the theory of financial markets and their relation to consumption and investment decisions, production, employment and prices.”

*Money and Finance in the Macro-Economic Process* by Tobin.

**E1983:** Gerard Debreu (1921-2004) “for having incorporated new analytical methods into economic theory and for his rigorous reformulation of the theory of general equilibrium”.

“Debreu’s classic monograph, The Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium, was published in 1959. In it, Debreu provided the mathematical underpinnings for the phenomenon of equilibrium in supply and demand. Debreu also made significant contributions to the theory of consumer behavior.”

*Economic Theory in the Mathematical Mode* by Debreu.


**E1989:** Trygve Haavelmo (1911-1999) “for his clarification of the probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of simultaneous economic structures”.

“Trygve Haavelmo was a pioneer in what became the field of economic forecasting. His statistical techniques made possible the development of econometric models that predict how a change in one aspect of the economy will affect others; that is, he demonstrated that statistical probability theory could be integrated into economic formulations. Haavelmo’s method contributed to the techniques of national economic forecasting.”

*Econometrics and the Welfare State* by Haavelmo.

**E1994:** John C. Harsanyi (1920-2000), John F. Nash Jr. (1928-2015) and Reinhard Selten (1930-2016) “for their pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games”

“John C. Harsanyi was awarded the Economic Sciences Prize in for his work in game theory and its application to economics. He showed how games of incomplete information can be analyzed thereby providing a theoretical foundation for a lively field of research – the economics of information. He is also known for researching utilitarian ethics and is considered one of the most important exponents of the “rule utilitarianism”.”

“John F. Nash is the only person who has been awarded both the Economic Sciences Prize and the Abel Prize. He received the Economic Sciences Prize for his work in game theory, more specifically the Nash equilibrium theory. He introduced the distinction between cooperative games and non-cooperative games. He also did ground breaking work in other mathematics and developed the Nash embedding theorem.”

“Reinhard Selten received the Economic Sciences Prize for his work in game theory, along with his co recipients John F. Nash Jr and John C. Harsanyi. He refined the Nash equilibrium concept for analyzing dynamic strategic interaction by getting rid of unlikely equilibria. He also applied the refined concept to analyses of oligopolistic competition. He is also well known for his work in bounded rationality. He also built the BonnEconLab at the University of Bonn.”

*Games with Incomplete Information* by Harsanyi.

*The Work of John Nash in Game Theory* by Nash.

*Multistage Game Models and Delay Supergames* by Selten.

**E1998:** Amartya Sen (1933) “for his contributions to welfare economics”.

“Which are the most important and fundamental resources in a community and how should we divide them? One focus of Amartya Sen's research is how individuals' values can be considered in collective decision-making and how welfare and poverty can be measured. His efforts stem from his interest in questions of distribution and, in particular, the lot of society's poorest members. Sen's studies have included famines, to create a deeper understanding of the economic reasons behind famine and poverty.”

*The Possibility of Social Choice* by Sen.


**E2002:** Daniel Kahneman (1934) “for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty” and Vernon L. Smith (1927) “for having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms”

“Daniel Kahneman began his prize-awarded research in the late 1960s. In order to increase understanding of how people make economic decisions, he drew on cognitive psychology in relation to the mental process used in forming judgements and making choices. His research on decision-making under uncertainty resulted in the formulation of a new branch of economics, prospect theory.”

“Vernon Smith has laid the foundation for the field of experimental economics. He has developed an array of experimental methods, setting standards for what constitutes a reliable laboratory experiment in economics. In his own experimental work, he has demonstrated the importance of alternative market institutions, e.g., how the revenue expected by a seller depends on the choice of auction method.”

*Maps of Bounded Rationality* by Kahneman.

*Constructivist and Ecological Rationality in Economics* by Smith..

**E2005:** Robert J. Aumann (1930) and Thomas C. Schelling (1921-2016) “for having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis”.

“Aumann was awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences for his theory of repeated games, which enhances our understanding of the prerequisites for cooperation. Insights into these issues help explain economic conflicts, such as price wars and trade wars. He was educated at MIT in Boston, where he received his Ph. D. in 1955. After moving to Israel in 1956, he was a member of the mathematics faculty at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.”

“Thomas Schelling specialized in the application of game theory to cases in which adversaries must repeatedly interact, especially in international trade, treaties and conflicts. His work prompted new developments in game theory and accelerated its use and application throughout the social sciences. Schelling’s analysis of strategic commitments has explained a wide range of phenomena, from the competitive strategies of firms to the delegation of political decision power.”

*War and Peace* by Aumann.

*An Astonishing Sixty Years: The Legacy of Hiroshima* by Schelling.

**E2017:** Richard H. Thaler (1945) “for his contributions to behavioural economics”.

“How do human traits govern individual economic decisions and what effect do they have on markets as a whole? Since the 1980s, Richard Thaler has analyzed economic decision-making with the aid of insights from psychology. He has paid special attention to three psychological factors: the tendency to not behave completely rationally, notions of fairness and reasonableness, and lack of self-control. His findings have had a profound influence on many areas of economic research and policy.”

*From Cashews to Nudges: The Evolution of Behavioral Economics* by Thaler.

**E2019:** Abhijit Banerjee (1961), Esther Duflo (1972) and Michael Kremer (1964) “for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”.

“One of humanity’s most urgent issues is the reduction of global poverty, in all its forms. Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer have introduced a new approach to obtaining reliable answers about the best ways to fight global poverty. It involves dividing this issue into smaller, more manageable, questions. Since the mid-1990s, they have been able to test a range of interventions in different areas using field experiments, for example for improving educational outcomes or child health.”

*Field Experiments and the Practice of Economics* by Banerjee.

*Field Experiments and the Practice of Policy* by Duflo.

*Experimentation, Innovation, and Economics* by Kremer.

**E2021:** David Card (1956) “for his empirical contributions to labour economics” and Joshua D. Angrist (1960) and Guido W. Imbens  (1963) “for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships”.

“Many of the big questions in the social sciences deal with cause and effect. Some of these questions are possible to answer using natural experiments, in which chance events or policy changes result in groups of people being treated differently. Using natural experiments, David Card has analysed the labour market effects of minimum wages, immigration and education. The results showed, among other things, that increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs, as was previously thought.”

“Many of the big questions in the social sciences deal with cause and effect. Some of these questions are possible to answer using natural experiments, in which chance events or policy changes result in groups of people being treated differently. In 1994, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens showed what conclusions about causation can be drawn from natural experiments in which people cannot be either forced or forbidden to participate in the programme being studied.”
