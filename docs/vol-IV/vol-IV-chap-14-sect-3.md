## 14.3. Contextualization of learning about the universe.

Cosmological knowledge has been created by organizing what has been *seen* through specific windows for watching and registering celestial objects: first through the human eye and optical telescopes and afterwards with the support of systems of modern telescopes placed on Earth or in satellites external to the terrestrial atmosphere. Three steps characterize the evolution of cosmology:
 
(1)	According to astrology and the development of prescientific astronomy by eye, it was believed that the positions of planets, stars and constellations defined the destiny of human beings. However, careful maps of their positions served as useful guides for navigation. According to this approach, the universe was a stationary and eternal scenario explained in terms of mysterious agents and miraculous circumstances.

(2)	Optical telescopes enlarged and deepened what could be seen with the naked eye because what was observed, measured, and described was communicated and interpretated in scientific terms. Then, the universe was conceived as a complicated scenario dynamically active and composed of many celestial objects among which the planet Earth was not central. This was a critical shift from philosophical speculations towards scientific explanations.

(3)	What now is called physical cosmology deals with the study and use of the emission, transport, and reception of signals different from visible light, like those produced by neutrinos or by gravitational waves. 

Three elements characterize contextualization of learning: the proposition of a problematic situation, the elaboration of generating questions which address the main issues of the theme to be contextualized, and the description of learning and evaluation activities to answer those questions. In what follows we apply this contextualization of learning procedure to analyze the content of Peebles´ Nobel Lecture. 

Firstly, we indicate that the problematic situation consists in the explanation of what cosmological knowledge is according to Peebles´ Nobel Lecture. Then we consider the following generating questions (GC):

</p>

The third component of contextualization of learning consists in a set of answers (Ans) for each one of the previous questions. The answers we suggest are expressed in terms of a set of paragraphs (Prg) contained in the Lecture. Each paragraph has been numbered and is identified by a short title describing its content.

In what follows, we describe the structure of a proposed reorganization of the Lecture according to the components of the contextualization of learning previously described. We do this in two levels: the first level corresponds to this section where we indicate each paragraph only in terms of the title explaining its content followed by its corresponding number. The second level corresponds to Appendix 14.1 which contains the complete description of the content of the Nobel Lecture, including a series of quotes taken from the original.
