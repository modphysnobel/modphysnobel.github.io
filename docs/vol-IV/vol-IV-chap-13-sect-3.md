## 13.3. Levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowing.

According to Piaget and García (1988) there are three levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowing: the level *intra* for the description of objects, the level *inter* for the transformation of concepts and the level *trans* for the construction of structures. We will associate these levels of operation to the categories describing the contributions made by Nobel laureates awarded in high energy physics: laboratories, experiments, and theories. By explaining all these contributions, we aim for understanding when and why they have been awarded with Nobel Prizes. Next we reorganize the composition of the lists of selected contributions of the Nobel laureates that have been considered in Sections 13.1 and 13.2.

According to the documents called *Facts* published in the Nobel Prize web page, we indicate the year each laureate started working on the subject, introduced a new concept or procedure, made a critical discovery, initiated a long-term project or started a pioneering contribution to the development or invention of a practical instrument or an experimental setting. In many cases we comment on some physics knowledge based on information contained in documents published in the Nobel Prize web page such as: *Award ceremony speech, Facts, Speed read, Press release. Popular information, and Advanced information*. All the references are indicated in the MLA style.

Around **1895** Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845-1923) discovered X-rays when he was experimenting with a Crookes tube. This tube consisted of a partially evacuated glass bulb, (filled with rarefied gas) containing two metal electrodes, the cathode and the anode. 
When a high voltage was applied between the electrodes, cathode rays (electrons) were projected in straight lines from the cathode. Although the apparatus was screened off, Röntgen noticed that a faint light was registered on a light-sensitive screen. This type of radiation, the X-ray, was generated because fast-moving electrons suddenly decelerated during their collision and interaction with the target anode. 

In **1896** Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) discovered spontaneous radioactivity when he analyzed the image formed in a sensitive photographic plate by a sort of radiation produced by certain salts of uranium, despite of covering the plate with aluminum foils; such radiation also made air conduct electricity. 
The disintegration of uranium generated the transmutation into a new element accompanied by the emissions of radiations: Alpha rays (nucleus of He atoms), Beta rays (electrons), and/or Gamma rays (radiation with the shortest wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum). Becquerel inferred that such effect was produced by the emission rays of a special nature.

In **1897** Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940) showed that cathode rays consisted of particles that conduct electricity and were part of atoms: the electrons.

In **1898** the Curies Pierre (1859-1906) and Marie (1867-1934) provided experimental proof of the existence of radioactive elements such as polonium and radium. They also examined many substances and minerals for signs of radioactivity as in actinium. They described the radioactive properties of these elements and demonstrated that radioactivity was a specific atomic property. 

Research on radioactivity has contributed to generate knowledge in next aspects: there is a new property of matter with the capability of spontaneously emitting certain type of radiation, specific experimental methods have been developed to produce radioactive elements, and a new source of energy has been found with no clear understanding at that time of its origin and properties. They demonstrated that some minerals like pitchblende, chalcolite and autunite were several times more radioactive as uranium. In 1910 she produced radium as a pure metal. Later she worked on the theory of atomic radioactive transformations. 

In **1899** Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) demonstrated that there were at least two distinct types of radiation emanating from a radioactive element: alpha radiation and beta radiation, afterwards interpreted respectively as ionized helium atoms He-4 (composed of two protons and two neutrons) and as electrons. 

In **1902** Rutherford and Frederick Soddy (1877-1956) proposed a transmutation theory explaining the transformation of elements. In between 1908 and 1913, Hans Geiger (1882-1945) and Ernest Marsden (1989-1970), Rutherford´ students, performed a series of experiments for testing Thomson atomic model called the “plum pudding”.  They observed that some alpha particles were dispersed after impacting a very thin foil of gold instead of passing through it, indicating that something like a coulombic repulsion was changing the trajectory of the positive incident radiation of alpha particles. This surprising result led Rutherford to propose an atomic model composed of a positive core or nucleus and a cloud of surrounding negative charges. Consequently, radioactivity had to be interpreted as something interior to the atomic system which will not anymore be considered as indivisible.

In **1910** Marie Curie (1867-1934) produced radium as a pure metal. Later she worked on the theory of atomic radioactive transformations.

In **1910** Robert Andrews Millikan (1868-1953) determined the magnitude of the electron’s charge by experimenting with small electrically charged drops subjected to the downward force of gravity and the upward attraction of an electrical field. 

In **1911** Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869-1959) constructed a cloud chamber which was a glass container with air and water vapor; an increase in the volume of this mixture of air and water vapor produced small water drops. If the air contained electrically charged particles—ions—then the droplets surrounded these charges. The traces left by ionizing radiation and particles that pass through the chamber become visible to be photographed. 

In **1919** Rutherford produced transmutations of atomic nuclei by bombarding nitrogen with helium nuclei obtained from a radium source. This transformation of nitrogen into oxygen was the first case of transmutation of elements by external means, the dream of alchemists.

In **1919** Francis William Aston (1877-1945) developed the mass spectrograph and build a map of different isotopes. 
	
In **1922** Arthur Holly Compton (1892-1962) directed X-ray photons onto a metal surface and observed that the X-rays’ wavelength increased because some of the incident photon energy was transferred to the electrons, confirming that electromagnetic radiation could be described as photon particles. 

For more details concerning the experiments made by Thomson, Millikan and Compton, see Volume I, Chapter 2. Production and control of electronic motions, Section 2.1. Regions for doing experiments and Section 2.2. Analysis of Physics Noble Prize Lectures.

In **1924** Prince Louis-Victor Pierre Raymond de Broglie (1892-1987) proposed that electrons could be understood both as particles and as waves, meaning that particles have an associated wave function describing their propagation and interactions. 

Note:  For more details concerning the De Broglie hypotheses and the diffraction of electrons experiments made by Davisson and Germer and by Thomson, see Volume III, Waves, Chapter 9.  Matter waves and quantum mechanics principles, Section 9.1. From a theoretical proposition to an experimental demonstration.

In **1925** Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) formulated the exclusion principle, which implies that no two electrons in an atom could have identical sets of quantum numbers. 

For more details concerning Pauli exclusion principle see Volume I. Motion, Chapter 1. Dictatorial and democratic conceptualizations of spaces. Section 1.2.  Conceptualizations of spaces and quantum statistics.

In **1927** Clinton Joseph Davisson (1881-1958) and George Paget Thomson (1892-1975) demonstrated, independently of one another, that electrons could be described as waves and present diffraction patterns. 

For more details concerning the experiments made by Davisson and Germer and by Thomson, see Volume III, Waves, Chapter 9.  Matter waves and quantum mechanics principles, Section 9.1. From a theoretical proposition to an experimental demonstration.

In **1929** Ernest Orlando Lawrence (1901- 1958) started thinking in the construction of a cyclotron for accelerating protons to high velocities. He applied a method called magnetic resonance acceleration by combining a constant homogeneous magnetic field and an oscillating electrical field with constant frequency. 
The charged particles moved in orbits with ever-increasing radii through stepwise acceleration in a spiral-shaped path before they collide with specific targets to penetrate atomic nucleus and produce nuclear reactions. He obtained a patent of this machine in 1934. The cyclotron has been also used in the production of artificially radioactive substances. 

In **1932** James Chadwick (1891-1974) experimentally confirmed the existence of neutrons as a new fundamental building-stone of matter. He also determined the neutron mass and the atomic weights of some elements. 

The smallest particles with negative and positive charges known at the time were the electron and the proton, respectively. Being part of atomic structures, they came out from the decomposition of the radioactive substances and from the disintegration of atoms and molecules. Although the atom is electrically neutral, the existence of isotopes indicated that something with mass but without charge was inside the nucleus: the neutron. Its existence was suggested by Ernest Rutherford around 1920.

When beryllium atoms were bombarded with alpha particles (nuclei of helium) a strong and penetrating radiation was observed; this radiation appeared to be radioactive -rays.  This radiation caused a disintegration of the atoms, similar to an explosion inside the nuclei. Chadwick studied such radiations and calculated the transformations of mass at collisions: an available procedure to detect the presence of a particle with mass but without charge.

In **1932** Carl David Anderson (1905-1991) discovered of the positron: a particle with a similar mass as the electron and a positive charge, confirming Dirac prediction about the existence of antimatter. 

Since **1930** Anderson was collaborating with Robert Millikan recording the tracks produced by cosmic radiations in a Wilson chamber equipped with very strong magnets; their first results were published in 1931. By analyzing photographs of those tracks Anderson found in 1932 one case where the curved path showed the same deviation as the negative electrons, but in the opposite direction, which corresponded to a positively charged particle. The production of positive and negative electrons out of radiation has an inverse process, the production of radiation through the impacts of a pair of positive or negative electrons. 

In **1932** Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett (1897-1974) in collaboration with Giuseppe Occhialini (1907-1993) connected a cloud chamber to a Geiger counter and detected the passage of particles. They also described how pairs of electrons and positrons could be formed out of photons. Blackett developed both the method and the apparatus. 

In **1932** John Douglas Cockcroft (1897-1967) and Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton (1903-1995) bombarded lithium with high velocity protons, causing their nuclei to split and to produce two alpha particles. In such transmutation of lithium, the gain in the liberated energy corresponded to a loss in the mass of the atomic nuclei. This was the first nuclear transmutation produced by artificial acceleration of particles under human controls.  

In **1933** Eugene Wigner (1902-1995) discovered that the force binding the nucleons together is weak at great distances and strong at short distances. The force between two nucleons is the same, regardless of whether they are protons or neutrons. Wigner also show that most essential properties of the nuclei follow from generally valid symmetries of the laws of motion. 

In **1934** Frédéric Joliot (1900-1958) and Irène Joliot-Curie (1897-1956) bombarded a thin piece of aluminum with alpha particles obtained from polonium and discovered that the radiation from the aluminum continued even after the source of radiation was removed. They created artificially the first radioactive element when aluminum atoms were converted into a radioactive isotope of phosphorus. 

In **1934** Enrico Fermi (1901-1954) and his Italian collaborators observed that when neutrons were used as projectiles and slowed down by a shield of paraffin, the interaction rate with nuclei increases. Fermi discovered radioactivity induced by neutrons and applied it to 22 different elements. In these processes radioactive isotopes were generated because the neutrons were captured and incorporated in the nucleus. Fermi also obtained nuclear synthesis and produced two new elements: Ausenium and Hesperium, corresponding to atomic numbers 93 and 94. 

In **1934** Hideki Yukawa (1907-1981) predicted the existence of a new particle, the meson, responsible of the strong nuclear force that maintained together protons and neutrons inside the atomic nucleus. The meson has a mass of nearly 200 times the mass of an electron, it is exchanged between nucleons, and when transformed it generates an electron and a neutrino, a very light particle without charge that was proposed in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958).

In **1938** and **1939** Hans Albrecht Bethe (1906-2005) revealed how the Sun behaves like a giant nuclear reactor in which two kinds of nuclear reactions produce energy. The dominant reaction occurs when four hydrogen nuclei links together to form one helium nucleus. However, in a more complex cycle of nuclear reactions carbon atoms acts as a catalyst. These fusion reactions create heat and light as another demonstration of the validity of Einstein´s equation "E = mc^2". The existence of stars follows a life cycle: to be born and then to grow and develop by burning fuel, finally they die burning out all their energy sources. 

In **1939** Otto Hahn (1879-1968) in collaboration with Fritz Strassman (1902-1980) irradiated uranium with neutrons and created barium. Hahn received this Prize “for his discovery of the fission of heavy nuclei”. 

Hahn and Lise Meitner (1878-1968) had studied the products obtained by projecting neutrons on to heaviest elements like thorium and uranium. Later, Meitner and Otto Frisch (1904-1979) proved that the uranium nucleus had been split and that the first nuclear fission reaction was obtained due to a chain reaction where matter was converted into energy.
 
In **1946** Clifford G. Shull (1915-2001) determined the structure of different molecules and materials using beams of neutrons created in a nuclear reactor. Shull was interested on where the atoms “are” (their structure)

In **1947** Cecil Frank Powell (1903-1969) discovered that the reaction of incident cosmic ray particles with atomic nuclei, as detected in a photographic emulsion, produced other short-lived particles: the pi-mesons. He introduced improvements in his photographic method for the treatment of the material, the research technique, and the optical equipment for analyzing the particle traces.

In **1948** Maria Goeppert Mayer (1906-1972) wrote the paper *On closed shells in nuclei*, when she collected the empirical evidence pointing out the significance of the magic numbers. Nuclear systems are particularly stable when the numbers of either kind of nucleons (protons and neutrons) is one of these: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. If nucleons move in orbits in a common field of force and these orbits are arranged in energetically well separated shells, the magic numbers should correspond to complete shells.

In **1949** J. Hans D. Jensen (1907-1973) developed a model in which nucleons were distributed in shells with different energy levels. The basic idea of the shell model developed in collaboration with Goeppert Mayer was that individual nucleons moves freely in an averaged potential. Their shell model gave convincing evidence for the existence of higher magic numbers and proposed that nucleons should have different energies when they “spin” in the same or opposite sense as it revolves around the nucleus. 

In **1948** Sin-Itiro Tomonaga (1906-1979), Julian Schwinger (1918-1994) and Richard P. Feynman (1918-1988); they were recognized "for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles". 

This theory is a quantum and relativistic explication of the interaction of charged particles and the electromagnetic field; in particular it implies the renormalization of the mass and the charge of the electrons. 

Through a renormalization procedure Tomonga interpreted the splitting of degenerated energy levels within the hydrogen atom (the Lamb shift). Schwinger also through a renormalization procedure reformulated the theory to explain that he electron’s magnetic moment proved to be somewhat larger than expected. Feynman created a new version of quantum electrodynamics introducing graphical procedure for the calculation of interaction probabilities (the Feynman diagrams).

During **1950** Bertram N. Brockhouse (1918-2003) worked on the development of the neutron diffraction technique and elaborated a chart of properties of molecules and materials. Brockhouse was interested on what the atoms “do” (their dynamics).

In **1950** Robert Hofstadter (1915-1990) started his studies on electron scattering in atomic nucleus by analyzing the distribution of charge and magnetism inside the nucleons. He also investigated the distribution in the nuclei of the magnetic moments of protons and neutrons. He built the experimental setting required for bombarding the nucleus with fast electrons and make accurate measurements. 

In **1950** Luis Walter Alvarez (1911-1988) introduced improvements in the bubble chamber by using liquid hydrogen and made new measurement systems and computer-based methods for analyzing large quantities of data of importance in the discovery of previously unknown fundamental particle resonances. 

Experiments with elementary particles are quite difficult mainly for two reasons: such particles require very high energies to be produced and a very complicated system needs to be created and operated to observe and register their existence and interpret their behavior. Elementary particles are quite small in size and fast in movements, therefore it is not possible to detect their motions; however, their trajectory can be followed when the particles leave some tracks while they pass through certain media. When the lifespan of the particles is extremely short there is no way to observe those tracks; the possibility is to register and afterwards to interpret instantaneous photographs of the reactions produced when those particles collide with other particles.

Since **1950** Frederick Reines (1918-1998) in collaboration with Clyde Cowan (1919-1974) were experimenting with radiation coming from a nuclear reactor and discovered neutrinos. The neutrino was a hypothetical particle introduced by Pauli in 1930 to explain the energy distribution of electrons emitted in the radioactive beta-decay process. Neutrinos are electrically neutral, weakly interacting and very light particles. There are six types of neutrinos: the electron neutrino and the positron neutrino, the muon neutrino and the antimuon neutrino, and the tau neutrino and the antitau neutrino.  

In **1950** James Rainwater (1917-1986) postulated that the atomic nucleus could be distorted and that certain nuclei had not spherical symmetry but were deformed as an ellipsoid because the valence nucleons influenced the shape of the inner nucleus. 

In **1952** Donald Arthur Glaser (1926-2013) invented the bubble chamber as an instrument for observing the tracks produced by charged particles when they pass through a chamber filled with a liquid at near-boiling point. When the pressure inside the chamber is reduced, strings of bubbles are formed around these charged atoms and afterwards their corresponding tracks can be photographed and analyzed.

In the years **1952-1953** Aage Niels Bohr (1922-2009) and Ben Roy Mottelson (1926-2022), they proved that the position of energy levels in certain nuclei could be explained by the assumption that they form a rotation spectrum produced by the coupling of oscillations of the nuclear surface to the movements of the individual nucleons.

In **1953** Murray Gell-Mann (1929-2019) published the first of a series of papers indicating how to classify the elementary particles and their interactions (the Eightfold Way). The main characteristics of this model are the following: 

- Experimental observed particles are composite of smaller building blocks called quarks. Particles are classified according to their symmetry properties.
- Nuclear forces maintain together protons and neutrons inside the atomic nucleus and are charge independent.
- Pi-mesons predicted by Yukawa form a triplet of particles that have nearly the same mass but different charges; they explain the interaction among nucleons.
- New particles heavier than the nucleons are produced when high-energy pi-mesons collide with nucleons. These particles form the group of baryons.
- Elementary particles can be transformed in others by the strong and the electromagnetic interactions only if the total hypercharge is conserved. This new concept is defined as twice the mean value of the charges in the multiplets formed by baryons.
- The nucleons belong to a supermultiplet of eight particles (an octet).  All particles are composed of only three kinds of particles: the quarks and of the corresponding antiparticles. Quarks have charges that are fractions of the proton charge.
- 1955 Emilio Gino Segrè (1905-1989) and Owen Chamberlain (1920-2006) confirmed the existence of the proton’s antiparticle, the antiproton. By a sort of the mirror symmetry, in the region of antimatter each particle has an antiparticle whose electric charge is the opposite. 
- The antiparticle of the electron is the positron (discovered in 1931) and of the proton, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom, it is the antiproton. When a pair of particle and antiparticle meet both are annihilated and their mass is converted into radiation. The controlled production of the antiproton required the high energies of the proton accelerator at Berkeley University in California. 

In **1956** Chen Ning Yang (1922) and Tsung-Dao (T.D.) Lee (1926) proposed that the left-right symmetry law is violated by the weak interaction. This was in contradiction with the assumption that the same physical laws apply where right and left were reversed and matter was replaced by antimatter.

In **1958** Rudolf Ludwig Mössbauer (1929-2011) discovered the resonance absorption of gamma radiation in atoms embedded in a crystal structure and developed a new experimental method for the investigation of the inner structure of nuclei and nucleons. He observed that in a gas a recoil effect occurs when an atom emits a photon.

In **1960** Sheldon Lee Glashow (1932), Abdus Salam (1926-1996) and Steven Weinberg (1933-2021) independently developed a theory in which the new concept of the electroweak force was introduced. They have been recognized “for their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current”. 

Elementary particles are fermions (they have half-integer spin) and constitute two families, light particles (leptons) and heavy particles (hadrons) formed by quarks. Light particles form three families consisting of pairs of particles: the electron ($e-$) and the electron neutrino ($ν_e$), the muon ($μ$) and the muon neutrino ($ν_μ$), and the tau ($τ$) and tau neutrino ($ν_τ$). Heavy particles (hadrons) are composed of mesons which are formed by quarks and antiquarks, and by baryons which are formed by combinations of three quarks.

Quarks are of six types or flavors each represented by the initial letter of its name; they form three generations of pairs: up (u) and down (d), charmed (c) and strange (s), top (t) and bottom (b). The triples of quarks that constitute protons and neutrons are, respectively, (uud) and (udd). In addition, for each quark there exists its corresponding antiquark in a somewhat analogous way that for the electron there exists its antielectron (a positively charged electron), the positron.

Bosons (have zero or integer spin) and correspond to four types of forces: the gravitational that is of attraction and the electromagnetic that can be of attraction or repulsion, the strong nuclear force that keeps protons and neutrons together inside the nucleus, and the weak nuclear force responsible for radioactivity and that affects particles such as neutrinos. The transformation of hydrogen into heavy hydrogen (deuterium), is caused by the weak force. 

The weak force makes a distinction between left and right; it has not the property of being reflection symmetric. The quanta that correspond to these four forces are boson: gravitons for the gravitational force, photons for the electromagnetic force, gluons for the strong nuclear force and particles $W^{-}$, $W^{+}$ and $Z^0$ for the weak nuclear force.

In **1960** Raymond Davis Jr. (1914-2006) showed that the sun's energy originates from nuclear reactions in which hydrogen atoms combine with helium atoms to produce neutrinos. Inside a mine in South Dakota, USA a large tank contained around 390,000 liters of a chlorine-rich liquid was prepared to trap neutrinos emitted from the Sun. The interaction of chlorine atoms with neutrinos formed argon atoms and by counting them the presence of neutrinos could be proved; those argon atoms are radioactive and have a lifetime of about 50 days.

Beginning **1960** Riccardo Giacconi (1931-2018) started studying emission of X-rays from stars and galaxies by means of telescopes in satellites. He constructed instruments and discovered X-ray sources outside our own solar system, cosmic background radiation with X-ray wavelengths as well as X-ray sources that probably contain black holes.

In **1960**, Yoichiro Nambu (1921-2015) formulated a mathematical theory for understanding spontaneous symmetry violations in subatomic physics. 
If natural laws are perfectly symmetrical and absolute, all the time they are valid throughout the entire universe. Three general principles of symmetry apply in physics: mirror symmetry (there is no difference between left and right), charge symmetry (antiparticles have the same properties but the opposite charge as the particles) and time symmetry (events are equally independent whether they occur forwards or backwards in time). These are respectively referred as P for parity, C for charge symmetry and T for time. 
Symmetries simplify many calculations; they play a decisive role for the mathematical description of the microworld and implicate the application of conservation laws at the particle level. However, phenomena like the following have shown the need for considering broken symmetries: 

•	The decay of the atom nucleus in the radioactive element cobalt 60 revealed that it did not follow the principles of mirror symmetry (the electrons that left the cobalt nucleus preferred one direction to another). In this case charge and mirror symmetries are broken separately, however, CP symmetry is conserved. 

•	In the radioactive decay of kaon particles, a small fraction of them did not follow the current mirror and charge symmetries, they broke the double CP symmetry. In this case each kaon particle is a combination of a quark and an antiquark and the weak force makes them switch identities: the quark becomes an antiquark while the antiquark becomes a quark.

•	Another spontaneous broken symmetry, the Higgs mechanism, destroyed the original symmetry between forces and gave the particles their masses in the very earliest stages of the universe.

In **1962** Leon M. Lederman (1922-2018), Melvin Schwartz (1932-2006) and Jack Steinberger (1921-2020) provided experimental evidence of the existence of a new type of neutrino, the muon neutrino. Their neutrino beam method has been used for the study of weak forces at high energies. 

As all matter is transparent to neutrinos, to measure their action it was necessary first to produce them as a decay product of pi-mesons generated when accelerated protons collided with beryllium atoms. A special detector was built to observe the results of neutrino collisions with matter by registering produced muons in a spark chamber. Neutrinos interact with matter only through the weak force.

In **1964** James Watson Cronin (1931-2016) and Val Logsdon Fitch (1923-2015) experimentally found that the matter-antimatter symmetry is violated when the neutral K-meson decays. They discovered that reactions going backward in time are not identical to those going forward meaning that there is an observed matter–antimatter asymmetry in the universe. 

The experiments were made using the proton accelerator at the AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchroton) at Brookhaven National Laboratory where a beam of neutral elementary particles was produced and their radioactive decay in flight was recorded and measured. They choose to study neutral K-mesons which consists of one-half ordinary matter and the other half antimatter. What their results imply is that the left-right asymmetry is not always completely compensated by transforming from matter to antimatter.

In **1964** François Englert (1932) and Robert Brout (1928-2011) and Peter W. Higgs (1929) proposed independently the theory of how particles acquire mass. 

The Higgs boson is the mechanism by which mass originates in the universe: everything in it is immersed in an invisible field whose quantum is the Higgs boson. When a particle moves within this field there is some resistance to movement and the faster the movement the greater the resistance, thus implying that this quantitative measure of inertia, the mass, will be greater. Depending on the intensity of the interaction of a particle with the Higgs boson, so will be the magnitude of its mass. The Higgs boson cannot be detected directly, only its fingerprints, because the instant it is produced it disintegrates into other particles that are produced at very high energies.  

In **1964**, Roger Penrose (1931) proposed critical mathematical tools to describe black holes. He showed that Einstein’s general theory of relativity means the formation of black holes and described black holes in detail: at their farthest depths is a singularity where all known laws of nature dissolve. 

According to the theory of general relativity, stars containing large concentrations of masses warp space-time and generate gravitational forces. In the vicinity of this super-dense region, space-time is encapsulated, giving rise to a black hole. This process is called gravitational collapse whereby the black hole traps everything that approaches it and then prevents it from leaving, even if it is light.

Certain solutions of the equations of general relativity technically correspond to a singularity wrapped in a closed surface, which curves the space-time of four dimensions and thus delimits the so-called event horizon of the black hole. Such a singularity means that all the mass of the star is concentrated in a mathematical point, which by definition is dimensionless. The greater the mass of the black hole, the larger the size of its event horizon and therefore, the more intense the gravitational field that exists inside it. The black hole is not seen, we only perceive the imprint left by its presence. 

In **1968** Georges Charpak (1924-2010) invented a multiwire proportional chamber for detecting very rare particle interactions. The entrance of particles in the chamber produced two effects: the liberation in cascade of electrons and the generation of currents in many thin, parallel wires arranged in a plane between two cathode planes. Afterwards, these currents were registered, amplified, and processed using computers directly connected with the detectors. 

Around **1970** Jerome I. Friedman (1930), Henry W. Kendall (1926-1999) and Richard E. Taylor (1929-2018) started a series of experiments with high-energy electrons colliding with protons and neutrons. They were using a two-mile-long accelerator at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California. Their results supported the theory that quarks are the building blocks of protons and neutrons and that the binding of them is due to the action of the bosons called gluons. 

In the early 1970s, Gerardus t'Hooft (1946) and Martinus J.G. Veltman (1931-2021) formulated and tested a mathematical theory that explained the quantum structure of electroweak interaction.   

A quantum field theory unifies the wave functions of quantum mechanics and the fields of electromagnetism. Electroweak interaction is understood as a relativistic quantum field theory where quantized fields are considered in terms of operators for the creation and annihilation of particles. The electroweak interaction refers to the unified treatment of electromagnetism and the weak force which underlies some forms of radioactivity, governs the decay of unstable subatomic particles such as mesons, and initiates the nuclear fusion reaction that fuels the Sun. The electroweak force is mediated by four exchange particles: the mass-less photon and the three field particles $W^{+}$, $W^{–}$ and $Z^0$.

In **1972**, Makoto Kobayashi (1944) and Toshihide Maskawa (1940-2021) provided a mathematics-based explanation of the discovery that the decay of certain particles (kaons) was asymmetrical.

In **1973** David J. Gross (1941), H. David Politzer (1949) and Frank Wilczek (1951) postulated the existence of a property called asymptotic freedom. For explaining this property, they proposed the mathematical framework called *Quantum ChromoDynamics* (QCD): the theory of the strong interaction between quarks mediated by gluons. 

The exchange of force between protons and neutrons in the nucleus occurs through interactions between quarks. This is the strong force that holds together the quarks and make up protons and neutrons. It has not been possible to detect free quarks; they must form aggregates. Each quark, in addition to have an electric charge which are a fraction of the proton’s, also have a special property called color charge (red, blue, or green). Gluons are the carriers of the interactions between quarks and have also the property of color charge; gluons interact not only with quarks but also with each other. The property of asymptotic freedom is manifested when at high energies quarks are very close and behave like free particles because quark color charge is weaker. 

In **1974** Burton Richter (1931-2018) and Samuel Chao Chung Ting (1936) independently of each other, discovered a new heavy particle (J/psi) and proved experimentally the existence of the fourth quark, the “charm”. 

The fourth quark was discovered in two different laboratories and with very different methods. Richter and his team from Stanford and Berkeley worked at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California. Ting and his team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. To give a name to the quark, the letter J was chosen at Brookhaven and the Greek letter ψ (psi) at Stanford.

Richter equipment was a sort of carousel (storage ring) where a stream of electrons and a stream of positrons go round in opposite directions. All the energy of the head-on collision gave rise to a motionless very heavy particle, which turned into several other particles by decay in a very short interval of time.

In Ting’s experiment high-speed protons collided with a motionless target area of beryllium. Looking for finding a new heavy particle, the experiments had the purpose of investigating how twins of one electron and one positron were born at very high energies. 

In a series of experiments from **1974** to **1977** Martin L. Perl (1927-2014) discovered a new particle—the tau lepton. The experiments consisted in producing frontal collisions between electrons and their antiparticles, positrons. The existence of the tau particle indicated the possibility of having a third family of elementary constituents of matter. 

The elementary particles are called fermions and are formed by three generations or families. The first family was established nearby 1960 as composed by the electron, the electron neutrino, and the up and down quarks. The second family was identified in 1974-76 as integrated by the muon, the muon neutrino and the charm and strange quarks. The new composed third family will be formed by the tau, the tau neutrino and the top and bottom quarks. The bottom quark was discovered in 1977; however, the top quark was found until 1994-1995.

Since **1980** Masatoshi Koshiba (1926-2020) measured the effects produced by neutrinos inside an enormous tank of 50,000-tonnes of water inside a mine in Japon. When neutrinos pass through this tank, they may interact with atomic nuclei in the water. This reaction leads to the release of an electron, creating small flashes of light to be detected by photomultipliers and then counted.

In **1983** Carlo Rubbia (1934) proposed and led experiments that, by allowing protons and antiprotons to collide at very high speeds, showed the existence of W and Z particles. Collaborating with him, Simon van der Meer (1925-2011) developed a method to accumulate a large number of energetic antiprotons in an accelerator ring. Rubbia developed the idea and van der Meer made it feasible. 

Since the **1990s**, Reinhard Genzel (1952) and Andrea Ghez (1965) and for almost thirty years they have developed and refined techniques for mapping the orbits of the brightest stars that are closest to the center of our galaxy. 

They measured the positions and travel speeds of distant stars in the area around a source of high-intensity radio waves called Sagittarius $A^{*}$. The star called S2 or S-O2 completes an elliptical orbit with respect to the center of the galaxy in less than 16 years. By measuring radial velocities of S2 as it approached and moved away from the center of the galaxy, astrophysicists realized that the cause of that effect could be none other than a black hole in Sagittarius $A^{*}$. This was the evidence that a super massive black hole was produced with a mass equivalent to around 4 million solar masses when a massive star collapsed under its own gravity.

In **1998** Takaaki Kajita (1959) built the Super-Kamiokande detector in a mine in Japan and discovered that neutrinos switch their identities before arriving. Neutrinos have been created in reactions between cosmic rays and the Earth’s atmospheres; however, the measurements showed that up to two thirds of the calculated amount was missing. This was explained in terms of neutrinos oscillations whose existence might imply that neutrinos do have very small mass. 

Since **2000** Arthur B. McDonald (1943) made measurements in a mine in Canada for studying neutrinos created in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Deviations in such measurements showed that in coming the neutrinos were having mid-flight metamorphosis switching between three different types. Although the Sun only produces electron-neutrinos some of them were not detected on traveling to Earth. As the Standard Model is based on neutrinos lacking mass and the oscillation of neutrinos implies that they have mass, that model must be revised. 

In **2012**, two experiments conducted at the CERN laboratory confirmed the existence of the Higgs particle. Two research groups of some 3,000 scientists each, managed to extract the Higgs particle from billions of particle collisions in the LHC (Large Hadron Collider),
