## 13.3. Levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowing.

According to Piaget and García (1988) there are three levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowing: the level *intra* for the description of objects, the level *inter* for the transformation of concepts and the level *trans* for the construction of structures. . We associate these levels of operation to three categories describing the scenario and the results of contributions made by Nobel laureates working in high energy physics: the laboratory work, the experimental purposes, and the theorical consequences.

The operation of the level *intra* is connected to the invention of experimental tools and the description of laboratories where research is done. These are the places and technological arrangements where tools, devices, instruments, apparatuses, and installations are the cognitive objects defining the experimental settings used to explore and learn about high energy physics.

The operation of the level *inter* is connected to the description of experiments for answering questions and proposing further challenges. These are the activities where concepts are tested by obtaining the values of observable and measurable quantities and by understanding their meanings. Cognitive relationships among physical concepts are proposed or proved for improving or transforming the explanations of physical concepts.

The operation of the level *trans* is connected to the description of theories as cognitive structures serving to interpret, explain, and very often predict physical phenomena. These are the important components describing the evolution of the body of knowledge called high energy physics.

The selected contributions of the Nobel laureates that have been considered in previous Sections 13.1 and 13.2 are now organized in terms of each one of the levels of operation of the mechanism of knowing. We identify each contribution with two dates: the first date, at the beginning of the line, indicates the year the Nobel Prize was awarded; the second date, written in parentheses at the end of the line, refers to the date where the contribution was initiated or reported. These contributions follow the chronological order of the year the Nobel Prize has been awarded. When the Nobel Prize corresponds to Chemistry the first date is underlined; all the other cases have been awarded in Physics.
