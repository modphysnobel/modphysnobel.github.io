## 13.3. Levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowing.

According to Piaget and García (1988) there are three levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowing: the level *intra* for the description of objects, the level *inter* for the transformation of concepts and the level *trans* for the construction of structures. These levels of operation are associated with three categories describing the scenario and the results of contributions made by Nobel laureates working in high energy physics: the laboratory works, the experimental purposes, and the theorical consequences. 

The operation of the level *intra* is connected to the description of laboratories where research is done. These are the places and technological arrangements where tools, devices, instruments, apparatuses, and installations are the cognitive objects defining the experimental settings used to explore and learn about high energy physics.

The operation of the level *inter* is connected to the description of experiments for answering questions and proposing further challenges. These are the activities where concepts are tested by obtaining the values of observable and measurable quantities and by understanding their meanings. Cognitive relationships among physical concepts are proposed or proved for improving or transforming the explanations of physical concepts.

The operation of the level *trans* is connected to the description of theories as cognitive structures serving to interpret, explain, and sometimes predict physical phenomena. These are the important components describing the evolution of the body of knowledge called high energy physics.

The selected contributions of the Nobel laureates that have been considered in previous Sections 13.1 and 13.2 are now organized in terms of each one of the levels of operation of the mechanism of knowing. In each case, the years indicated in parentheses correspond to the date where the contribution was initiated or reported.
