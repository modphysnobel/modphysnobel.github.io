## 13.1. Steps in the development of Nuclear Physics.

The main developments in nuclear physics made in the period 1895 – 1953 are considered in two steps: N1 - Atomic structure and electronic properties (1895-1919) and N2 - Production of new particles and detection of new interaction forces (1922-1953). We start with a descriptive summary of the main developments reported in each step, taking information from documents published in the Nobel Prize web page such as: Award ceremony speech, Facts, Speed read, Press release. Popular information, and Advanced information, Work and Nobel lecture. 

Afterwards, we present a timeline description of these developments by considering those documents called *WORK* that have been published in the Nobel Prize web page. We obtain information from those documents indicating the year each laureate started working on the subject, introduced a new concept or procedure, made a critical discovery, initiated a long-term project or started a pioneering contribution to the development or invention of a practical instrument or an experimental setting. Such dates do not correspond to the years the respective Nobel Prize were awarded.

The timeline contains two parts: the first one is a box indicating the year where the reported work was initiated and a short description of the corresponding development, and the second one is a small paragraph explaining its content.

### N1 - Atomic structure and electronic properties.

New phenomena were observed and there were no possibilities for understanding them in the frame of classical physics; for instance, the transformation of radioactive elements, the discovery of new elements, and the existence of isotopes. These phenomena lead to new structural models of atomic matter.

Henri Becquerel observed the effect of the disintegration of uranium that produced the transmutation into new elements accompanied by the emissions of radiations: Alpha rays (nucleus of He atoms), Beta rays (electrons), and/or Gamma rays (radiation with the shortest wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum).

Research on radioactivity has contributed to generate knowledge in next aspects: there is a new property of matter with the capability of spontaneously emitting certain type of radiation; specific experimental methods have been developed to produce radioactive elements, and a new source of energy has been found with no clear understanding of its origin and properties.

The smallest particles with negative and positive charges known at the time were the electron and the proton, respectively. Being part of atomic structures, they came out from the decomposition of the radioactive substances and from the disintegration of atoms and molecules. Although the atom is electrically neutral, the existence of isotopes indicated that something with mass but without charge was inside the nucleus: the neutron.

Two Rutherford´ students (Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden) performed a series of experiments for testing Thomson atomic model called the “plum pudding”. They observed that some alpha particles were dispersed after impacting a very thin foil of gold instead of passing through it. This was an indication that something like a coulombic repulsion was changing the trajectory of the positive incident radiation of alpha particles. This surprising result led Rutherford to propose an atomic model composed of a positive core or nucleus and a cloud of surrounding negative charges, the electrons. Consequently, radioactivity had to be interpreted as something interior to the atomic system, not anymore indivisible.

•	Around **1895** Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845-1923) discovered X-rays when he was experimenting with a Crookes tube. This type of radiation was generated because fast-moving electrons suddenly decelerated during their colliding interaction with the target anode.
	
•	In **1896** Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) discovered spontaneous radioactivity when he analyzed the image formed in a sensitive photographic plate by a sort of radiation produced by certain salts of uranium, even though he had covered the plate with aluminum foils; such radiation also made air conduct electricity.
	
•	In **1897** Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940) showed that cathode rays conduced electricity as particles forming part of atoms: the electrons.
	
•	In **1898** the Curies Pierre (1859-1906) and Marie (1867-1934) provided experimental proof of the existence of radioactive elements such as polonium and radium. They also examined many substances and minerals for signs of radioactivity as in actinium. They described the radioactive properties of these elements and demonstrated that radioactivity was a specific atomic property.
	
•	In **1899** Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) demonstrated that there were at least two distinct types of radiation emanating from a radioactive element: alpha radiation and beta radiation, afterwards interpreted respectively as ionized helium atoms He-4 (composed of two protons and two neutrons) and as electrons.
	
•	In **1902** Rutherford and Frederick Soddy (1877-1956) proposed a transmutation theory explaining the transformation of elements. In between 1908 and 1913, Hans Geiger (1882-1945) and Ernest Marsden (1989-1970) performed a series of experiments for testing Thomson atomic model called the “plum pudding”.
	
•	In **1910** Marie Curie (1867-1934) produced radium as a pure metal and worked on the theory of atomic radioactive transformations.
	
•	In **1910** Robert Andrews Millikan (1868-1953) determined the magnitude of the electron’s charge by experimenting with small electrically charged drops subjected to the downward force of gravity and the upward attraction of an external electrical field.
	
•	In **1911** Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869-1959) constructed a cloud chamber which was a glass container with a mixture of air and water vapor. An increase in the volume of this mixture produced small water drops. When the air contained electrically charged particles (ions), some droplets were formed surrounding these charges. The traces left by ionizing radiation and particles that pass through the chamber become visible to be photographed.
	
•	In **1919** Rutherford produced transmutations of atomic nuclei by bombarding nitrogen with helium nuclei obtained from a radium source. This transformation of nitrogen into oxygen was the first case of transmutation of elements by external means, the dream of alchemists.
	
•	In **1919** Francis William Aston (1877-1945) developed a mass spectrograph to build a map of different isotopes.

### N2 - Production of new particles and detection of new interaction forces.

Designing and building accelerators of particles and creating appropriate detection instruments transformed the way of doing experimental research in physics. Understanding the nucleus models and discovering new particles like neutrons and positrons required the consideration of new types of forces, aside gravitation and electromagnetism: the strong force for explaining the nuclear binding between protons and neutrons (existence of mesons) and the weak force responsible of radioactivity. The artificial production of radioactivity opened new possibilities for the transformation of elements and for the liberation of energy.

The fact that photons are quantized energy electromagnetic radiations, and that electrons could be diffracted implied the existence of quanta of energy and a dual behavior of electrons. Furthermore, a restriction on the electronic quantum numbers was proposed by the Pauli exclusion principle and tracks created by the passage of particles indicated the presence of subatomic particles.

Ernest Lawrence applied a method called magnetic resonance acceleration by combining a constant homogeneous magnetic field and an oscillating electrical field with constant frequency. Charged particles that moved under the influence of such fields described orbits with ever-increasing radii through stepwise acceleration in a spiral-shaped path before they collide with specific targets to penetrate atomic nucleus and produce nuclear reactions. Later, this machine, the cyclotron, has been also used in the production of artificially radioactive substances.

When beryllium atoms were bombarded with alpha particles (nuclei of helium) a strong and penetrating radiation was observed; this radiation appeared to be radioactive γ-rays. This radiation caused a disintegration of the atoms, similar to an explosion inside the nuclei. James Chadwick studied such radiations and calculated the transformations of mass-produced during collisions: an available procedure to detect the presence of a particle with mass but without charge: the neutrons.

Robert Millikan recorded the tracks produced by cosmic radiations in a Wilson chamber equipped with very strong magnets. By analyzing photographs of those tracks Carl Anderson discovered the positron: he found one case where the curved path showed the same deviation as the negative electrons, but in the opposite direction, which corresponded to a positively charged particle.

According to Hans Bethe, the existence of stars follows a life cycle: to be born and then to grow and develop by burning fuel, finally they die burning out all their energy sources. The dominant reaction occurs when four hydrogen nuclei links together to form one helium nucleus. However, in a more complex cycle of nuclear reactions carbon atoms acts as a catalyst. These fusion reactions create heat and light as another demonstration of the validity of Einstein´s equation ($E = mc^2$).

Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner studied the products obtained by projecting neutrons onto heaviest elements like thorium and uranium. Later, Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch proved that the uranium nucleus had been fragmented. This was the first nuclear fission reaction obtained due to a chain reaction where matter was converted into energy in a laboratory.

Tracks created by the passage of particles indicated the presence of subatomic particles. Furthermore, fission of heavy nuclei was produced first as a laboratory experiment and afterwards lead to the production of atomic bombs. New experiments and theories were developed to produce and explain phenomena such as: the invention of new devices for detecting particles, the use of nuclear reactors for spectroscopical studies, the prove of the existence of neutrinos, and the explanation of nuclear structure and motions. The quantized interaction of radiation with matter was proposed by developing quantum electrodynamics.

•	In **1922** Arthur Holly Compton (1892-1962) directed X-ray photons onto a metal surface and observed that the X-rays’ wavelength increased because some of the incident photon energy was transferred to the electrons, confirming that electromagnetic radiation could be described as photons.
	
•	In **1924** Louis-Victor Pierre Raymond de Broglie (1892-1987) proposed that electrons could be understood both as particles and as waves, meaning that particles have an associated wave function describing their propagation and interactions. The existence of matter waves was proposed by him.
	
•	In **1925** Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) formulated the exclusion principle, which implies that no two electrons in an atom could have identical sets of quantum numbers.
	
•	In **1927** Clinton Joseph Davisson (1881-1958) and George Paget Thomson (1892-1975) demonstrated, independently of one another, that electrons could be described as waves and present diffraction patterns.

•	In **1932** John Douglas Cockcroft (1897-1967) and Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton (1903-1995) bombarded lithium with high velocity protons, causing their nuclei to split and to produce two alpha particles. This was the first nuclear transmutation produced by artificial acceleration of particles under human controls.
	
•	In **1933** Eugene Wigner (1902-1995) discovered that the force binding the nucleons together is weak at great distances and strong at short distances. The force between two nucleons is the same, regardless of whether they are protons or neutrons. Wigner also demonstrated that most essential properties of the nuclei follow from generally valid symmetries of the laws of motion.
	
•	In **1934** Frédéric Joliot (1900-1958) and Irène Joliot-Curie (1897-1956) bombarded a thin piece of aluminum with alpha particles obtained from polonium and discovered that the radiation from the aluminum continued even after the source of radiation was removed. They created artificially the first radioactive element when aluminum atoms were converted into a radioactive isotope of phosphorus.
	
•	In **1934** Enrico Fermi (1901-1954) and collaborators observed that when neutrons were used as projectiles and slowed down by a shield of paraffin, the interaction rate with nuclei increases. Fermi discovered radioactivity induced by neutrons and applied it to 22 different elements. Fermi also obtained nuclear synthesis and produced two new elements: Ausenium and Hesperium, corresponding to atomic numbers 93 and 94.
	
•	In **1934** Hideki Yukawa (1907-1981) predicted the existence of a new particle, the meson, responsible of the strong nuclear force that maintained together protons and neutrons inside the atomic nucleus. The meson has a mass of nearly 200 times the mass of an electron, it is exchanged between nucleons, and when transformed it generates an electron and a neutrino, a very light particle without charge that was proposed in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958).
	
•	In **1938** and **1939** Hans Albrecht Bethe (1906-2005) revealed how the Sun behaves like a giant nuclear reactor in which two kinds of nuclear reactions produce energy.
	
•	In **1939** Otto Hahn (1879-1968) in collaboration with Fritz Strassman (1902-1980) irradiated uranium with neutrons and created barium. Hahn received this Prize “for his discovery of the fission of heavy nuclei”.
	
•	In **1946** Clifford G. Shull (1915-2001) determined the structure of different molecules and materials using beams of neutrons created in a nuclear reactor. Shull was interested on where the atoms “are” (their structure).
	
•	In **1947** Cecil Frank Powell (1903-1969) discovered that the reaction of incident cosmic ray particles with atomic nuclei, as detected in a photographic emulsion, produced other short-lived particles: the pi-mesons.
	
•	In **1948** Maria Goeppert Mayer (1906-1972) wrote the paper On closed shells in nuclei, when she collected the empirical evidence pointing out the significance of the magic numbers.
	
•	During **1948**, working through a renormalization procedure, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga (1906-1979) interpreted the splitting of degenerated energy levels within the hydrogen atom (the Lamb shift), Julian Schwinger (1918-1994) reformulated the theory to explain that he electron’s magnetic moment proved to be somewhat larger than expected, and Richard P. Feynman (1918-1988) created a new version of quantum electrodynamics introducing a graphical procedure for the calculation of interaction probabilities (the Feynman diagrams).
	
•	In **1949** J. Hans D. Jensen (1907-1973) developed a model in which nucleons were distributed in shells with different energy levels, even though individual nucleons moved freely in an averaged potential.
	
•	During **1950** Bertram N. Brockhouse (1918-2003) worked on the development of the neutron diffraction technique and elaborated a chart of properties of molecules and materials. Brockhouse was interested on what the atoms “do” (their dynamics).
	
•	In **1950** Robert Hofstadter (1915-1990) started his studies on electron scattering in atomic nucleus by analyzing the distribution of charge and magnetism inside the nucleons. He also investigated these distributions bombarding the nucleus with fast electrons and made accurate measurements in the nuclei of the magnetic moments of protons and neutrons.
	
•	Since **1950** Frederick Reines (1918-1998) in collaboration with Clyde Cowan (1919-1974) were experimenting with radiation coming from a nuclear reactor and discovered neutrinos.
	
•	In **1950** James Rainwater (1917-1986) postulated that the atomic nucleus could be distorted and that certain nuclei had not spherical symmetry but were deformed as an ellipsoid because the valence nucleons influenced the shape of the inner nucleus.
	
•	In **1952** Donald Arthur Glaser (1926-2013) invented the bubble chamber as an instrument for observing the tracks produced by charged particles when they pass through a chamber filled with a liquid at near-boiling point. When the pressure inside the chamber is reduced, strings of bubbles are formed around these charged atoms and afterwards their corresponding tracks can be photographed and analyzed.
	
•	In the years **1952-1953** Aage Niels Bohr (1922-2009) and Ben Roy Mottelson (1926-2022), they proved that the position of energy levels in certain nuclei could be explained by the assumption that they form a rotational spectrum produced by the coupling of oscillations of the nuclear surface to the movements of the individual nucleons.
