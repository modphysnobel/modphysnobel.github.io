## 13. Exploring the atomic nucleus and the cosmic zoo of particles.

*What structures do have the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles?*


This is the first chapter of a series of three dedicated to the Universe. Although works recognized with Physics Nobel Prizes have been awarded to no more than three individuals, they were based on contributions made by many people; they were accomplished with the support of powerful technological resources. What is relevant for educational purposes is to understand what problems have been addressed and solved, as well as to have an idea of what procedures have shown new results and promising research routes. The content of this Chapter is the following:

In this chapter 13 we focus on the description of structures and the explanation of models concerning the atomic nucleus (Section 13.1) and the elementary particles (Section 13.2). Two tables contain descriptions of Physics and Chemistry Nobel Prizes related to nuclear physics (Table 13.1) and to particle physics (Table 13.2). Finally, in Section 13.3 we consider *Steps in the cognitive development of high energy physics.*

We identify each Nobel Prize contribution with the shorthand of the discipline (Ph or Ch) and the year of the award. Afterwards we indicate a date: the year where according to the document called *Facts*, published in the Nobel Prize web page, the laureate started working on the subject, introduced a new concept or procedure, made a critical discovery or developed a practical instrument or device. For each awarded Nobel Prize, we include the title of the corresponding *Nobel Lectures* and at the end of the chapter, we indicate those documents that have been consulted or quoted. In some cases, we present also brief notes explaining physics basic knowledge.

## 13.1. Nuclear Physics.

The first half of last century was the time for the initial formulations of two new forms of physical explanations: wave mechanics, later renamed quantum mechanics, and special and general relativity. Starting with a reasonable understanding of simple chemical reactions it was then necessary to approach a new sort of reactions in regions of quite different sizes, times, and energies. New devices and experimental methodologies were required to observe and measure into these regions. This Section refers to the transition where the study of chemical reactions at the molecular and atomic levels lead into the study of nuclear reactions under the effects of strong and weak forces. 

Table 13.1 shows two moments in the study of the atomic nucleus and in the development of applications of nuclear energy: the first moment with only one Physics Prize beginning in 1903 and followed by six Prizes in Chemistry till 1935, and a second moment starting in 1935 and going till 1994 with 16 Physics Prizes and only one Chemistry Prize. After 1935, the production, explanations and utilization of nuclear reactions was awarded more in Physics than in Chemistry. For different reasons no Nobel Prizes were awarded: in Physics in 1916, 1931 and 1934 and in Chemistry in 1916, 1917, 1919, 1924. In both disciplines no Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1940, 1941 and 1942. because of World War II.

The first moment in the development of nuclear physics refers to 32 years (1903-1935) at the beginning of last century; it represents the initial step of exploration of the new phenomenon of radioactivity (natural and artificial) and the formulation of a new model of the atomic structure revealing the existence of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. This moment was characterized by the discovery of new elements in the periodic table, the synthesis of radioactive elements and the existence of isotopes and heavy hydrogen. 

The second moment of 59 years (1935-1994) corresponds to the full development of nuclear physics. It started with the discovery of particles like neutrons, positrons (electrons with positive charge) and antiprotons. It was accompanied with the explanation of the role of mesons in the production of the nuclear force, the building of devices for tracking trajectories of particles by using cloud chambers or photography, and the utilization of methods like nuclear magnetic resonance, electron scattering and neutron scattering for determining the structure of the nucleus and the nucleons by assuming new kind of interacting forces.

The existence of laboratories requiring teams of many scientists and technicians for designing and building new machines made possible the production, acceleration and detection of subatomic particles. The transmutation of atomic nuclei and the production of new radioactive elements served as a prelude for the discovery of the fission of heavy nuclei, with dramatic consequences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

Each line of Table 13.1 contains two elements: the year of the Nobel prize award with an indication of the corresponding discipline (Ph for Physics or Ch for Chemistry), and the quotation of the Nobel Committee containing the name of the laureates and the reasons for recognizing their work (written in quotation marks). Prizes in Physics are written with different letter type than those in Chemistry.

Next, for each Nobel Prize included previously in Table 13.1 we indicate the year when each laureate did start working on the issue that later will be recognized with the award and explain the main corresponding conceptual developments and accomplishments. At the end of each Prize, we include the titles of their Nobel Lectures. The information has been obtained from Nobel Prize documents indicated at the end of the Chapter.

### First moment in the development of nuclear physics (1903-1935).

**Ph-1903:** In 1896 Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) discovered spontaneous radioactivity when he analyzed the image formed in a sensitive photographic plate by a sort of radiation produced by certain salts of uranium, despite of covering the plate with aluminum foils; such radiation made also air conduct electricity. 

The disintegration of uranium generated the transmutation into a new element accompanied by the emissions of radiations: Alpha rays (nucleus of He atoms), Beta rays (electrons), and/or Gamma rays (radiation with the shortest wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum). Becquerel inferred that such effect was produced by the emission rays of a special nature.

In 1898 the Curies Pierre (1859-1906) and Marie (1867-1934) provided experimental proof of the existence of radioactive elements such as polonium and radium. They also examined many substances and minerals for signs of radioactivity as in actinium. They described the radioactive properties of these elements and demonstrated that radioactivity was a specific atomic property. 

Research on radioactivity has contributed to generate knowledge in next aspects: there is a new property of matter with the capability of spontaneously emitting certain type of radiation, specific experimental methods have been developed to produce radioactive elements, and a new source of energy has been found with no clear understanding at that time of its origin and properties.

Nobel Lectures: *On Radioactivity, a New Property of Matter* by Becquerel and *Radioactive Substances, Especially Radium* by Pierre Curie. (No Lecture was delivered by Mme. Curie).

**Ch-1908:**  In 1899 Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) demonstrated that there were at least two distinct types of radiation emanating from a radioactive element: alpha radiation and beta radiation, afterwards interpreted respectively as ionized helium atoms He-4 (composed of two protons and two neutrons) and as electrons. In 1902 Rutherford and Frederick Soddy (1877-1956) proposed a transmutation theory explaining the transformation of elements. 

In between 1908 and 1913, Hans Geiger (1882-1945) and Ernest Marsden (1989-1970), Rutherford´ students, performed a series of experiments for testing Thomson atomic model called the “plum pudding”. They observed that some alpha particles were dispersed after impacting a very thin foil of gold instead of passing through it, indicating that something like a coulombic repulsion was changing the trajectory of the positive incident radiation of alpha particles. This surprising result led Rutherford to propose an atomic model composed of a positive core or nucleus and a cloud of surrounding negative charges. Consequently, radioactivity had to be interpreted as something interior to the atomic system which will not anymore be considered as indivisible. 

Later, in 1919 Rutherford produced transmutations of atomic nuclei by bombarding nitrogen with helium nuclei obtained from a radium source. This transformation of nitrogen into oxygen was the first case of transmutation of elements by external means, the dream of alchemists.

Nobel Lecture: *The Chemical Nature of the Alpha Particles from Radioactive Substances* by Rutherford.

**Ch-1911:** In 1898 Marie Sklodowska Curie (1867-1934) discovered with her husband Pierre Curie the chemical elements radium and polonium and study their radioactive properties. They demonstrated that some minerals like pitchblende, chalcolite and autunite were several times more radioactive as uranium. In 1910 she produced radium as a pure metal. Later she worked on the theory of atomic radioactive transformations. 

Nobel Lecture: *Radium and the New Concepts in Chemistry* by Marie Curie.

**Ch-1921:** In 1913 Frederick Soddy (1878-1956) introduced the term isotope (from Greek ισοζ- the same and τοποζ-place) to indicate those elements that are in the same place in the Periodic Table, but their nucleus has a different number of neutrons, so they have different atomic weights. 

Nobel Lecture: *The Origins of the Conception of Isotopes* by Soddy.

**Ch-1922:** In 1919 Francis William Aston (1877-1945) developed the mass spectrograph and build a map of different isotopes. 

Nobel Lecture: *Mass Spectra and Isotopes* by Aston.

**Ch-1934:** In 1932 Harold Clayton Urey (1893-1981) obtained the isotope of hydrogen called deuterium; heavy water contains deuterium instead of hydrogen. 

Nobel Lecture: *Some Thermodynamic Properties of Hydrogen and Deuterium* by Urey.

**Ch-1935:** In 1934 Frédéric Joliot (1900-1958) and Irène Joliot-Curie (1897-1956) bombarded a thin piece of aluminum with alpha particles obtained from polonium and discovered that the radiation from the aluminum continued even after the source of radiation was removed. They created artificially the first radioactive element when aluminum atoms were converted into a radioactive isotope of phosphorus. 

Nobel Lectures: *Chemical Evidence of the Transmutation of Elements* by Joliot and *Artificial Production of Radioactive Elements* by Joliot-Curie.

### Second moment in the development of nuclear physics (1935-1994).

**Ph-1935:** In 1932 James Chadwick (1891-1974) experimentally confirmed the existence of neutrons as a new fundamental building-stone of matter. He also determined the neutron mass and the atomic weights of some elements. 

The smallest particles with negative and positive charges known at the time were the electron and the proton, respectively. Being part of atomic structures, they came out from the decomposition of the radioactive substances and from the disintegration of atoms and molecules. Although the atom is electrically neutral, the existence of isotopes indicated that something with mass but without charge was inside the nucleus: the neutron. Its existence was suggested by Ernest Rutherford around 1920.

When beryllium atoms were bombarded with alpha particles (nuclei of helium) a strong and penetrating radiation was observed; this radiation appeared to be radioactive γ-rays. This radiation caused a disintegration of the atoms, similar to an explosion inside the nuclei. Chadwick studied such radiations and calculated the transformations of mass at collisions: an available procedure to detect the presence of a particle with mass but without charge.

Nobel Lecture: *The Neutron and Its Properties* by Chadwick.

**Ph-1936:** In 1932 Carl David Anderson (1905-1991) discovered of the positron:  a particle with a similar mass as the electron and a positive charge, confirming Dirac prediction about the existence of antimatter. This year, the Physics Nobel Prize was shared with Victor Franz Hess (1883-1964) for his discovery of cosmic radiation. 

Since 1930 Anderson was collaborating with Robert Millikan recording the tracks produced by cosmic radiations in a Wilson chamber equipped with very strong magnets; their first results were published in 1931. By analyzing photographs of those tracks Anderson found in 1932 one case where the curved path showed the same deviation as the negative electrons, but in the opposite direction, which corresponded to a positively charged particle. The production of positive and negative electrons out of radiation has an inverse process, the production of radiation through the impacts of a pair of positive or negative electrons. 

Nobel Lecture: *The Production and Properties of Positrons* by Anderson.

**Ph-1938:** In 1934 Enrico Fermi (1901-1954) and his Italian collaborators observed that when neutrons were used as projectiles and slowed down by a shield of paraffin, the interaction rate with nuclei increases. Fermi discovered radioactivity induced by neutrons and applied it to 22 different elements. In these processes radioactive isotopes were generated because the neutrons were captured and incorporated in the nucleus. Fermi also obtained nuclear synthesis and produced two new elements: Ausenium and Hesperium, corresponding to atomic numbers 93 and 94. 

Nobel Lecture: *Artificial Radioactivity Produced by Neutron Bombardment* by Fermi.

**Ph-1944:** In 1938 Isaac Isidor Rabi (1898-1988) discovered nuclear magnetic resonance experimenting with a beam of molecules that passed through a magnetic field and were exposed to radio waves. The nuclei inside a strong constant magnetic field were perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field that reoriented them; when the nuclei returned to their original positions emitted electromagnetic radiations of characteristic frequencies. No Nobel Lecture was delivered.

**Ch-1944:** In 1939 Otto Hahn (1879-1968) in collaboration with Fritz Strassman (1902-1980) irradiated uranium with neutrons and created barium. Hahn received this Prize “for his discovery of the fission of heavy nuclei”. 

Hahn and Lise Meitner (1878-1968) had studied the products obtained by projecting neutrons on to heaviest elements like thorium and uranium. Later, Meitner and Otto Frisch (1904-1979) proved that the uranium nucleus had been split and that the first nuclear fission reaction was obtained due to a chain reaction where matter was converted into energy.
 
Nobel Lecture: *From the Natural Transmutations of Uranium to Its Artificial Fission* by Hahn.

**Ph-1948:** In 1932 Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett (1897-1974) in collaboration with Giuseppe Occhialini (1907-1993) connected a cloud chamber to a Geiger counter and detected the passage of particles. They also described how pairs of electrons and positrons could be formed out of photons. Blackett developed both the method and the apparatus. 

Nobel Lecture: *Chamber Researches in Nuclear Physics and Cosmic Radiation* by Blackett.
 
**Ph-1949:** In 1934 Hideki Yukawa (1907-1981) predicted the existence of a new particle, the meson, responsible of the strong nuclear force that maintained together protons and neutrons inside the atomic nucleus. The meson has a mass of nearly 200 times the mass of an electron, it is exchanged between nucleons, and when transformed it generates an electron and a neutrino, a very light particle without charge that was proposed in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958). 

Nobel Lecture: *Meson Theory in Its Developments* by Yukawa.

**Ph-1950:** In 1947 Cecil Frank Powell (1903-1969) discovered that the reaction of incident cosmic ray particles with atomic nuclei, as detected in a photographic emulsion, produced other short-lived particles: the pi-mesons. He introduced improvements in his photographic method for the treatment of the material, the research technique, and the optical equipment for analyzing the particle traces. 

Nobel Lecture: *The Cosmic Radiation* by Powell.

**Ph-1951:** In 1932 John Douglas Cockcroft (1897-1967) and Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton (1903-1995) bombarded lithium with high velocity protons, causing their nuclei to split and to produce two alpha particles. In such transmutation of lithium the gain in the liberated energy corresponded to a loss in the mass of the atomic nuclei. This was the first nuclear transmutation produced by artificial acceleration of particles under human controls.  

Nobel Lectures: *Experiments on the Interaction of High-Speed Nucleons with Atomic Nuclei* by Cockcroft and *The Artificial Production of Fast Particles* by Walton.

**Ph-1952:** In 1946, Felix Bloch (1905-1983) and Edward Purcell (1912-1997) developed methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements that improved the determination of nuclear magnetic moments through resonance with radio waves. 

Nobel Lectures: *The Principle of Nuclear Induction* by Bloch and *Research in Nuclear Magnetism* by Purcell.

**Ph-1959:** In 1955 Emilio Gino Segrè (1905-1989) and Owen Chamberlain (1920-2006) confirmed the existence of the proton’s antiparticle, the antiproton. By a sort of the mirror symmetry, in the region of antimatter each particle has an antiparticle whose electric charge is the opposite. The antiparticle of the electron is the positron (discovered in 1931) and of the proton, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom, it is the antiproton. When a pair of particle and antiparticle meet both are annihilated and their mass is converted into radiation. The controlled production of the antiproton required the high energies of the Bevatron, the proton accelerator at Berkeley University in California. 

Nobel Lectures: *Properties of Antinucleons* by Segré and *The Early Antiproton Work* by Chamberlain.

**Ph-1961:** In 1950 Robert Hofstadter (1915-1990) started his studies on electron scattering in atomic nucleus by analyzing the distribution of charge and magnetism inside the nucleons. He also investigated the distribution in the nuclei of the magnetic moments of protons and neutrons. He built the experimental setting required for bombarding the nucleus with fast electrons and make accurate measurements. 

In 1958 Rudolf Ludwig Mössbauer (1929-2011) discovered the resonance absorption of gamma radiation in atoms embedded in a crystal structure and developed a new experimental method for the investigation of the inner structure of nuclei and nucleons. He observed that in a gas a recoil effect occurs when an atom emits a photon.

Nobel Lectures: *The Electron-Scattering Method and Its Application to the Structure of Nuclei and Nucleons* by Hofstadter and *Recoilless Nuclear Resonance Absorption of Gamma Radiation* by Mössbauer.

**Ph-1963:** In 1933 Eugene Wigner (1902-1995) discovered that the force binding the nucleons together is weak at great distances and strong at short distances. The force between two nucleons is the same, regardless of whether they are protons or neutrons. Wigner also show that most essential properties of the nuclei follow from generally valid symmetries of the laws of motion. 

In 1948 Maria Goeppert Mayer (1906-1972) wrote the paper *On closed shells in nuclei*, when she collected the empirical evidence pointing out the significance of the magic numbers. Nuclear systems are particularly stable when the numbers of either kind of nucleons (protons and neutrons) is one of these: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. If nucleons move in orbits in a common field of force and these orbits are arranged in energetically well separated shells, the magic numbers should correspond to complete shells.

In 1949 J. Hans D. Jensen (1907-1973) developed a model in which nucleons were distributed in shells with different energy levels. The basic idea of the shell model developed in collaboration with Goeppert Mayer was that individual nucleons moves freely in an averaged potential. Their shell model gave convincing evidence for the existence of higher magic numbers and proposed that nucleons should have different energies when they “spin” in the same or opposite sense as it revolves around the nucleus. 

Nobel Lectures: *Events, Laws of Nature, and Invariance Principles* by Wigner, *The Shell Model* by Goeppert Mayer, and *Glimpses at the History of the Nuclear Structure Theory*  by Jensen.

**Ph-1967:** In 1938 and 1939 Hans Albrecht Bethe (1906-2005) revealed how the Sun behaves like a giant nuclear reactor in which two kinds of nuclear reactions produce energy. The dominant reaction occurs when four hydrogen nuclei links together to form one helium nucleus. However, in a more complex cycle of nuclear reactions carbon atoms acts as a catalyst. These fusion reactions create heat and light as another demonstration of the validity of Einstein´s equation $E = mc^2$. The existence of stars follows a life cycle: to be born and then to grow and develop by burning fuel, finally they die burning out all their energy sources. 

Nobel Lecture: *Energy Production in Stars* by Bethe.

**Ph-1975:** In 1950 James Rainwater (1917-1986) postulated that the atomic nucleus could be distorted and that certain nuclei had not spherical symmetry but were deformed as an ellipsoid because the valence nucleons influenced the shape of the inner nucleus. 

In the years 1952-1953 Aage Niels Bohr (1922-2009) and Ben Roy Mottelson (1926-2022), they proved that the position of energy levels in certain nuclei could be explained by the assumption that they form a rotation spectrum produced by the coupling of oscillations of the nuclear surface to the movements of the individual nucleons. 

Nobel Lectures: *Background for the Spheroidal Nuclear Model Proposal* by Rainwater, *Rotational Motion in Nuclei* by Bohr, and *Elementary Modes of Excitation in the Nucleus* by Mottelson. 

**Ph-1983:** In 1930 Subramanyan Chandrasekhar (1910-1995) formulated theories concerning the structure of stars, in particular the stability problem in different phases of their evolution. 

In 1950 William Alfred Fowler (1911-1995) showed how all the natural elements in the Periodic Table are forged when certain nuclear reactions occur under extreme conditions of high temperatures. 

Nobel Lectures: *On Stars, Their Evolution and Their Stability* by Chandrasekhar and *Experimental and Theoretical Nuclear Astrophysics; the Quest for the Origin of the Elements* by Fowler.

**Ph-1994:** In 1946 Clifford G. Shull (1915-2001) determined the structure of different molecules and materials using beams of neutrons created in a nuclear reactor. During 1950 Bertram N. Brockhouse (1918-2003) worked on the development of the neutron diffraction technique and elaborated a chart of properties of molecules and materials. In a certain way Shull was interested where the atoms “are” (their structure) and Brockhouse what the atoms “do” (their dynamics).
