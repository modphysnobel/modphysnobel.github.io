# 13. Development of knowledge in high energy physics.     


*What are the structures of the atomic nuclei and of the elementary particles?*

This is the first chapter dedicated to the Universe. It is a review of a selection of Nobel Prizes that have contributed to improve our understanding of high energy physics (nuclear physics and particle physics) as well as to make possible several technological applications. We also describe the levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowledge concerning high energy physics. Cosmology is considered in next Chapter 14.

### Learning objectives of Chapter 13.
	
After this Chapter you should be able to: 

- Describe the main steps and contributions made by experimental and theoretical developments in high energy physics. 
- Analize the main developments in high energy physics that have been awarded with Nobel Prizes, mostly in Physics and few in Chemistry.
- Relate the levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowledge to the descriptions of the laboratory work, the experimental purposes, and the theorical implications concerning high energy physics.

### Description of content of Chapter 13.

Section 13.1.  Steps in the development of Nuclear Physics.

This Section deals with two steps related to experimental and theoretical developments in nuclear physics made by Nobel Prize laureates; it contains a commented timeline of such developments.

Section 13.2.  Steps in the development of Particle Physics.

This Section deals with two steps related to experimental and theoretical developments in particle physics made by Nobel Prize laureates; it contains a commented timeline of such developments.

Section 13.3.  Levels of operation of the mechanism of knowing.

The levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowing (inter, intra and trans) correspond to different contributions made by Nobel laureates. These contributions are organized into three categories: the laboratory work, the experimental purposes, and the theorical consequences.

## 13.1. Steps in the development of Nuclear Physics.

The main achievements in nuclear physics awarded with Physics Nobel Prizes in the period 1895 – 1953 are considered in two steps: N1 - Atomic structure and electronic properties (1895-1919) and N2 - Production of particles and detection of interaction forces (1922-1953). In what follows, previous steps are considered in terms of two elements: 

(1) A table indicating in the first column, in chronological order, the year when the future laureate started to work on a specific problem, in the second column a brief description of the corresponding achievements and in the third column the year of the Nobel Prize recognition. 

(2) An explanation of each Noble Prize award including the names of the laureates, the reasons for their award, and a full quotation of the Nobel document called WORK describing the contribution of each laureate and the year he (she) began working on the problem, as well as the title of the corresponding Nobel Lecture. We identify each Nobel Prize with the shorthand of the discipline (Ph for Physics or Ch for Chemistry) and the year of the award. The sequence of these descriptions follows the chronological order of the Prize recognition. The name of each laureate leads to a hyperlink containing biographical information. All the references to Nobel documents are given in MLA format.


### N1. Atomic structure and electronic properties (1895-1919).

**Ph1901** to [Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen) “in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him”.

WORK: “In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen studied cathode radiation, which occurs when an electrical charge is applied to two metal plates inside a glass tube filled with rarefied gas. Although the apparatus was screened off, he noticed a faint light on light-sensitive screens that happened to be close by. Further investigations revealed that this was caused by a penetrating, previously unknown type of radiation. X-ray radiation became a powerful tool for physical experiments and examining the body's interior.”

**Ph1903** to [Antoine Henri Becquerel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Becquerel) “in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity” and to [Pierre Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Curie) and [Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie), née Sklodowska “in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel”.

WORK (Becquerel): “When Henri Becquerel investigated the newly discovered X-rays in 1896, it led to studies of how uranium salts are affected by light. By accident, he discovered that uranium salts spontaneously emit a penetrating radiation that can be registered on a photographic plate. Further studies made it clear that this radiation was something new and not X-ray radiation: he had discovered a new phenomenon, radioactivity.”

**Ph1906** to [Joseph John Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson) “in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases”.

WORK: “The idea that electricity is transmitted by a tiny particle related to the atom was first forwarded in the 1830s. In the 1890s, J.J. Thomson managed to estimate its magnitude by performing experiments with charged particles in gases. In 1897 he showed that cathode rays (radiation emitted when a voltage is applied between two metal plates inside a glass tube filled with low-pressure gas) consist of particles— electrons—that conduct electricity. Thomson also concluded that electrons are part of atoms.”

**Ch1908** to [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford) “for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances”.

WORK: “The discovery of radioactivity in 1896 led to a series of more in-depth investigations. In 1899 Ernest Rutherford demonstrated that there were at least two distinct types of radiation: alpha radiation and beta radiation. He discovered that radioactive preparations gave rise to the formation of gases. Working with Frederick Soddy, Rutherford advanced the hypothesis that helium gas could be formed from radioactive substances. In 1902 they formulated a revolutionary theory: that elements could disintegrate and be transformed into other elements.”

**Ch1911** to Marie Curie, née Sklodowska “in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element”.

WORK: ”After Marie Skłodowska Curie and Pierre Curie first discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium, Marie continued to investigate their properties. In 1910 she successfully produced radium as a pure metal, which proved the new element's existence beyond a doubt. She also documented the properties of the radioactive elements and their compounds. Radioactive compounds became important as sources of radiation in both scientific experiments and in the field of medicine, where they are used to treat tumors.”

**Ch1922** to [Francis William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_William_Aston) Aston “for his discovery, by means of his mass spectrograph, of isotopes, in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole-number rule”.

WORK: “After it became clear that elements could have different isotopes, i.e., occur in different variants with different atomic weights, Francis Aston developed the mass spectrograph in 1919 to map the different isotopes. In the mass spectrograph, beams of atoms were generated in a tube with the aid of an electrical field. When the beams passed through an electrical and magnetic field, the lighter isotopes were bent more than the heavier ones. Aston came to the conclusion that the weight of the isotopes was very close to whole-number multiples of a unit.”

**Ph1923** to Robert [Andrews Millikan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Andrews_Millikan) “for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect”.

WORK: “During the 1890s the theory that electricity was conveyed by a miniscule unit, the electron, gained acceptance. In 1910 Robert Millikan succeeded in precisely determining the magnitude of the electron’s charge. Small electrically charged drops of oil were suspended between two metal plates where they were subjected to the downward force of gravity and the upward attraction of an electrical field. By measuring how the various drops of oil moved about, Millikan showed that their charge always was a multiple of a precisely determined charge—the electron’s charge.”

**Ph1927** to [Charles Thomson Rees Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Thomson_Rees_Wilson) “for his method of making the paths of electrically charged particles visible by condensation of vapour”.

WORK:” If the volume of a mixture of air and water vapor increases, small water drops form. If the air contains electrically charged particles—ions—then droplet formation occurs around these especially. C.T.R. Wilson exploited this phenomenon when he constructed his cloud chamber in 1911—a glass container with air and water vapor and ingenious devices that allow traces left by ionizing radiation and particles that pass through the chamber to become visible and be photographed. The cloud chamber became an important tool in physics.”

**Ph1927** to [Arthur Holly Compton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Compton) “for his discovery of the effect named after him”.

WORK: “According to Einstein’s photoelectric effect theory, light consists of quanta, “packages” with definite energies corresponding to certain frequencies. A light quantum is called a photon. When Arthur Compton directed X-ray photons onto a metal surface in 1922, electrons were emancipated and the X-rays’ wavelength increased because some of the incident photon energy was transferred to the electrons. The experiment confirmed that electromagnetic radiation could also be described as photon particles following the laws of mechanics.”

**Ph1929** to [Prince Louis-Victor Pierre Raymond de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie) “for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons”.

WORK:” In the beginning of the 20th century, quantum physics evolved from the idea that energy is conveyed in only certain fixed amounts. An early finding indicated that light can be regarded as both waves and particles. In 1924 Louis de Broglie introduced the idea that particles, such as electrons, could be described not only as particles but also as waves. This was substantiated by the way streams of electrons were reflected against crystals and spread through thin metal foils. The idea had great significance for the continued evolution of quantum mechanics.”

**Ph1935** to [James Chadwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chadwick) “for the discovery of the neutron”.

WORK:” When Herbert Becker and Walter Bothe directed alpha particles (helium nuclei) at beryllium in 1930, a strong, penetrating radiation was emitted. One hypothesis was that this could be high-energy electromagnetic radiation. In 1932, however, James Chadwick proved that it consisted of a neutral particle with about the same mass as a proton. Ernest Rutherford had earlier proposed that such a particle might exist in atomic nuclei. Its existence now proven, it was called a “neutron”.”

WORK (Joliot and Joliot-Curie): “Radiation from radioactive substances also became an important tool in investigating atoms. When Frédéric Joliot and Irene Joliot-Curie bombarded a thin piece of aluminum with alpha particles (helium atom nuclei) in 1934, a new kind of radiation was discovered that left traces inside an apparatus known as a cloud chamber. The pair discovered that the radiation from the aluminum continued even after the source of radiation was removed. This was because aluminum atoms had been converted into a radioactive isotope of phosphorus. That meant that, for the first time in history, a radioactive element had been created artificially.”

**Ph1936** to [Carl David Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_David_Anderson) “for his discovery of the positron”.

WORK:” In developing quantum mechanical theory, Dirac predicted that all matter has a kind of mirror image—antimatter. A particle and its antiparticle, if charged, should have opposite charges. By studying the tracks of cosmic ray particles in a cloud chamber, in 1932 Carl Anderson discovered a positively-charged particle with a mass seemingly equal to that of an electron. Anderson’s particle was the first antiparticle proven by experiment and was named a “positron”.

In 1927 Clinton Davisson and G.P. Thomson demonstrated, independently of one another, that electrons could be described as waves. When an electron beam passed through a nickel crystal, diffraction patterns appeared.”

WORK: “Discovered in 1932, the neutron proved to be a powerful new tool for studying atoms. When Enrico Fermi irradiated heavy atoms with neutrons, these were captured by the atomic nuclei, creating new and often radioactive isotopes. In 1934, Fermi and his colleagues discovered that when neutrons are slowed down, e.g. by paraffin shielding, the interaction rate with nuclei increases. This revelation led to the discovery of many hitherto-unknown radioactive isotopes.”

WORK: “If the nuclei of atoms are bombarded by beams of particles, such as protons, the atoms can be transformed into different variants of the element with different masses, so-called isotopes. The likelihood that particles can penetrate the atomic nucleus and bring about a nuclear reaction increases if the bombarding particles have a high velocity. In 1929 Ernest Lawrence developed an apparatus known as a cyclotron that used electrical and magnetic fields to accelerate protons to high velocities in a spiral-shaped path before they collide with their target.”

When Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman irradiated uranium with neutrons in 1939, they created barium, which was far too light an element to be a decay product of uranium. Hahn's long-time colleague, Lise Meitner, and her nephew, Otto Frisch, tackled the problem from a theoretical standpoint and proved that the uranium nucleus had been split. The phenomenon, later called “fission”, proved important in developing nuclear weapons and energy.”

As this model developed, electrons were assigned certain quantum numbers corresponding to distinct states of energy and movement. In 1925, Wolfgang Pauli introduced two new numbers and formulated the Pauli principle, which proposed that no two electrons in an atom could have identical sets of quantum numbers. It was later discovered that protons and neutrons in nuclei could also be assigned quantum numbers and that Pauli’s principle applied here too.”

Cecil Powell made improvements to this technique in order to study radiation and nuclear reactions. In 1947 he discovered that incident cosmic ray particles could react with atomic nuclei in the emulsion, creating other, short-lived particles. These particles turned out to be pi-mesons, the particles proposed by Yukawa as mediating the strong force binding protons and neutrons in nuclei.”

However, only a very few nuclear reactions could be achieved using alpha particles. John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton developed a device, an accelerator, to generate more penetrating radiation. Using a strong electric field, protons were accelerated to high velocities. In 1932, they bombarded lithium with protons, causing their nuclei to split and producing two alpha particles.”

WORK (Walton): “Ernest Rutherford used alpha particles from radioactive elements to study nuclear reactions and used his findings to convert nitrogen into oxygen. However, only a very few nuclear reactions could be achieved using alpha particles. Ernest Walton and John Cockcroft developed a device, an accelerator, to generate more penetrating radiation. Using a strong electric field, protons were accelerated to high velocities. In 1932, they bombarded lithium with protons, causing their nuclei to split and producing two alpha particles.

**Ph1960** to [Donald Arthur Glaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_A._Glaser) “for the invention of the bubble chamber”.

WORK: “Our ability to study the smallest components of our world took a giant leap forward when C.T.R. Wilson invented the cloud chamber, where the trails of charged particles can be observed. Donald Glaser's invention of the bubble chamber in 1952 made it possible to study particles with higher energies. When charged particles rush forward through the chamber filled with a liquid at near-boiling point, they ionize atoms they pass by. When the pressure inside the chamber is then reduced, bubbles form around these charged atoms. The particles' tracks can then be photographed and analyzed.”

**Ph1963** to [Eugene Paul Wigner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Wigner) “for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles” and to [Maria Goeppert Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Goeppert_Mayer) and [J. Hans D. Jensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Hans_D._Jensen) “for their discoveries concerning nuclear shell structure”.

WORK (Wigner): “After discovery of the neutron, it became evident that the atomic nucleus is made up of nucleons—protons and neutrons—that are affected by a cohesive force. In 1933 Eugene Wigner discovered that the force binding the nucleons together is very weak when the distance between them is great, but very strong when the nucleons are close to one another as in the atomic nucleus. Wigner also described several characteristics of the nucleons and the nuclear force, including the fact that the force between two nucleons is the same, regardless of whether they are protons or neutrons.

WORK (Goeppert Mayer and Jensen): “According to modern physics, an atom consists of a nucleus made up of nucleons—protons and neutrons—surrounded by electrons distributed within shells with a fixed number of electrons. It became apparent that atomic nuclei in which the number of nucleons corresponded to full electron shells are especially stable. In 1949 Maria Goeppert Mayer and Hans Jensen developed a model in which nucleons were distributed in shells with different energy levels. The model reflected observations of directions in which nucleons rotated around their own axes and around the center of the nucleus.”

**Ph1965** to  [Shinichiro Tomonaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin%27ichir%C5%8D_Tomonaga), [Julian Schwinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger) and [Richard P. Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) “for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles”.

WORK (Tomonoga): “Following the establishment of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, an initial relativistic theory was formulated for the interaction between charged particles and electromagnetic fields. The theory had to be reformulated, however, partly due to the observation of the Lamb shift in 1947, in which the supposed single energy level within a hydrogen atom was instead proven to be two similar levels. Sin-Itiro Tomonga solved this problem in 1948 through a “renormalization” and thereby contributed to a new quantum electrodynamics.”

WORK (Schwinger): “Following the establishment of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, an initial relativistic theory was formulated for the interaction between charged particles and electromagnetic fields.

WORK (Feynman): “Following the establishment of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, an initial relativistic theory was formulated for the interaction between charged particles and electromagnetic fields.

These diagrams facilitate the calculation of interaction probabilities.”

**Ph1967** to [Hans Albrecht Bethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe) “for his contributions to the theory of nuclear reactions, especially his discoveries concerning the energy production in stars”.

WORK: “The discovery of fission—the splitting of heavy nuclei—revealed the liberation of large quantities of energy; an effect now exploited in nuclear reactors. This energy is generated by differences in mass. Energy is also liberated when light nuclei combine to form heavier ones, i.e. fusion. In 1938, Hans Bethe proved that fusion produces the enormous energy emitted by stars. He proposed two different processes, both of which result in hydrogen nuclei fusing with helium nuclei.”

WORK (Bohr, Mottelson and Rainwater): “According to modern physics, an atomic nucleus consists of nucleons—protons and neutrons. In earlier models the nucleus was depicted as being spherical, but this proved to be inaccurate. In 1950 James Rainwater postulated that the atomic nucleus can be distorted. The nucleons in the outer portions of the atomic nucleus move about in paths and interact with nucleons inside, causing the nucleus to be distorted. Independently of Rainwater, Aage Bohr arrived at the same theory and corroborated it through experiments in collaboration with Ben Mottelson in 1952 and 1953.”
