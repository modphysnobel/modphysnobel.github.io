## 13. Development of knowledge in high energy physics.     

!!! abstract "Introduction"

	*What are the structures of the atomic nuclei and the elementary particles?*

	This is the first chapter dedicated to the Universe. We describe the levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowledge concerning high energy physics: nuclear physics and particle physics. A selection of those laboratories, experiments and theories in high energy physics that have been recognized with Nobel Prizes are considered.

	**Learning objectives of Chapter 13.**
	
	After this Chapter you should be able to: 

	- Describe the main steps and contributions to the development of nuclear physics that have been awarded with Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry.
	- Describe the main steps and contributions to the development of particle physics that have been awarded with Nobel Prizes in Physics.   
	- Analize the levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowledge related to the descriptions of laboratories, experiments, and theories in high energy physics.

## 13.1. Steps in the development of Nuclear Physics.

Three steps (N1 – N3) describe the main developments of nuclear physics made in the period 1895 - 1953. Each one of these steps descriptions contains a timeline of selected contributions of Nobel laureates. We indicate the year when the activities of the laureates were initiated not when the Nobel Prizes were awarded.

	New phenomena were observed and there were no possibilities for understanding them in the frame of classical physics, for instance, the transformation of radioactive elements, the discovery of new elements, the existence of isotopes, the fact that photons are quantized energy electromagnetic radiations, and the diffraction of electrons. A restriction on the electronic quantum numbers was proposed by the Pauli exclusion principle. Tracks created by the passage of particles indicated the presence of subatomic particles.

	[N01] Röntgen produces X-rays (1895).

	[N02] Becquerel discovers spontaneous radioactivity (1896).
	
	[N03] Thomson discovers the electron (1897).
	
	[N04] Pierre and Marie Curie discover polonium and radium (1898).
	
	[N05] Rutherford shows that radioactive elements generate ionized helium atoms and electrons (1899).

	[N06] Marie Curie produces radium as a pure metal (1910).

	[N07] Millikan determines the electron’s charge (1910).

	[N08] Wilson constructs a cloud chamber to register the tracks of particles (1911).

	[N09] Rutherford produces transmutations of atomic nuclei (1919).

	[N10] Aston uses the mass spectrograph for discovering isotopes (1919).

	[N11] Compton studies the dispersion of X-ray photons after collision with electrons (1922).

	[N12] de Broglie proposes the wave nature of the electron (1924).

	[N13] Pauli proposes the exclusion principle for electrons (1925).

	[N14] Davisson and Thomson demonstrate the diffraction of electrons (1927).

	Designing and building accelerators of particles and creating appropriate detection instruments transformed the way of doing experimental research in physics. Understanding the nucleus models and discovering new particles like neutrons and positrons required the consideration of new types of forces, aside gravitation and electromagnetism: the strong force for explaining the nuclear binding between protons and neutrons (existence of mesons) and the weak force responsible of radioactivity. The artificial production of radioactivity opened new possibilities for the transformation of elements and for the liberation of energy.

	[N15] Lawrence builds a cyclotron for accelerating protons (1929).
	
	[N16] Chadwick confirms the existence of neutrons (1932).

	[N17] Anderson discovers the positron (1932).

	[N18] Blackett and Occhialini study the passage of particles through cloud chambers (1932).

	[N19] Cockcroft and Walton artificially produce transmutation of atoms (1932).

	[N20] Wigner studies the force binding the nucleons together and their symmetries (1933). 

	[N21] Frédéric Joliot and Irène Joliot-Curie create artificially the first radioactive element (1934).

	[N22] Fermi produces artificial radioactivity by neutron bombardment (1934).
	
	[N23] Yukawa predicts the existence of mesons (1934).
	
	[N24] Bethe studies energy production in stars. (1938-1939).

	Fission of heavy nuclei was produced first as a laboratory experiment and afterwards led to the production of atomic bombs. Experiments and theories accompanied the invention of new devices for detecting particles, the use of nuclear reactors for spectroscopical studies, the prove of the existence of neutrinos, and the explanation of nuclear structure and motions. The quantized interaction of radiation with matter was proposed by developing quantum electrodynamics.
