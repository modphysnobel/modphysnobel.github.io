## 13.2. Steps in the development of Particle Physics.

Two steps correspond to developments of particle physics made in the period 1953 – 2012: P1- Classification of elementary particles (1953-1964), and P2- Beyond the Standard model (1964-2012). 

Although there is certain overlap between the closure of nuclear step N2 and the beginning of particle step P1, we proceed as in the previous section13.1 concerning nuclear physics. Altogether, the four steps of the development of high energy physics (steps N1, N2, P1 and P2) show the transitions from the study of atomic models towards the discovery and use of nuclear properties and from them towards the understanding and classification of elementary particles. Such transitions imply significant changes in scales of energy, time, and size.



### P1. Classification of elementary particles (1953-1964).

**Ph1957** to [Chen Ning Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Chen-Ning) and [Tsung-Dao (T.D.) Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsung-Dao_Lee) “for their penetrating investigation of the so-called parity laws which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles”.

WORK (Lee and Yang): “For a long time, physicists assumed that various symmetries characterized nature. In a kind of “mirror world” where right and left were reversed and matter was replaced by antimatter, the same physical laws would apply, they posited. The equality of these laws was questioned concerning the decay of certain elementary particles, however, in 1956 and Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang formulated a theory that the left-right symmetry law is violated by the weak interaction. Measurements of electrons’ direction of motion during a cobalt isotope’s beta decay confirmed this.”

**Ph1959** to [Emilio Gino Segrè](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Segr%C3%A8) and to [Owen Chamberlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Chamberlain) “for their discovery of the antiproton”.

WORK (Segrè and Chamberlain): “The matter around us has a kind of mirror image—antimatter. A particle and its antiparticle have an opposite electrical charge, among other things. The electron’s antiparticle positron was the first to be discovered. With high concentrations of energy, a pair of particles and antiparticles can be created, but when a particle and an antiparticle meet, both are annihilated and their mass is converted into radiation. In a 1955 experiment with a powerful particle accelerator, Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain confirmed the existence of the proton’s antiparticle, the antiproton.”

**Ph1969** to [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann) “for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions”.

WORK: “During the 1950s and 1960s, new accelerators and apparatuses helped identify many new elementary particles. In theoretical works from the same period, Murray Gell-Mann classified particles and their interactions. He proposed that observed particles are in fact composite, that is, comprised of smaller building blocks called quarks. According to this theory, as-yet-undiscovered particles should exist. When these were later found in experiments, the theory was accepted.”

**Ph1988** to [Leon M. Lederman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_M._Lederman), [Melvin Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Schwartz) and [Jack Steinberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Steinberger) “for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino”.

WORK (Lederman, Schwartz and Steinberger): “In decays of certain elementary particles, neutrinos are produced; particles that occasionally interact with matter to produce electrons. Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger managed to create a beam of neutrinos using a high-energy accelerator. In 1962, they discovered that, in some cases, instead of producing an electron, a muon (200 times heavier than an electron) was produced, proving the existence of a new type of neutrino, the muon neutrino. These particles, collectively called “leptons”, could then be systematically classified in families.”

**Ph2002** to [Raymond Davis Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Davis_Jr.) and [Masatoshi Koshiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masatoshi_Koshiba) “for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos” and to [Riccardo Giacconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Giacconi) “for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources”.

WORK (Davis): “In certain nuclear reactions (such as when protons combine to form helium nuclei) elusive particles called neutrinos are created. Raymond Davies wanted to detect neutrinos in radiation from space to confirm the theory that this kind of nuclear reaction is the source of the sun’s energy. Beginning in the 1960s, he placed a large tank containing a chlorine-rich liquid inside a mine. In rare cases, a neutrino interacted with a chlorine atom to form an argon atom. By counting these argon atoms, neutrinos from space could be detected.”

WORK (Koshiba): “Certain nuclear reactions, including those where hydrogen atoms combine with helium, form elusive particles called neutrinos. By proving the existence of neutrinos in cosmic radiation, Raymond Davis showed that the sun's energy originates from such nuclear reactions. From 1980, Masatoshi Koshiba provided further proof of this through measurements taken inside an enormous water tank within a mine. In rare cases, neutrinos react with atomic nuclei in water, creating an electron and thus a flash of light that can be detected.”

WORK (Giacconi): “Stars and galaxies emit not only visible light, but also X-rays. However, the X-rays dissipate as they pass through the earth’s atmosphere, so X-rays from the cosmos have to be studied by means of telescopes in satellites. Beginning in the 1960s, Riccardo Giacconi made several pivotal contributions to the development of such telescopes. With the telescopes, he discovered X-ray sources outside our own solar system, cosmic background radiation with X-ray wavelengths as well as X-ray sources that probably contain black holes.”

WORK (Glashow, Salam and Weinberg): “According to modern physics, four fundamental forces exist in nature. Electromagnetic interaction is one of these. The weak interaction—responsible, for example, for the beta decay of nuclei—is another. Thanks to contributions made by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg in 1968, these two interactions were unified to one single, called electroweak. The theory predicted, for example, that weak interaction manifests itself in “neutral weak currents” when certain elementary particles interact. This was later confirmed.”

**Ph1992** to [Georges Charpak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Charpak) “for his invention and development of particle detectors, in particular the multiwire proportional chamber”.

WORK: “When onrushing particles collide and form showers of new particles, they offer a key to understanding the smallest components of matter. In 1968 Georges Charpak developed the multiwire proportional chamber, which represented a more effective way of detecting particles. The multiwire chamber contains many parallel metal wires surrounded by a gas. Between the chamber’s walls and the threads, an electrical charge is introduced. When particles enter, electrons in the gas are liberated in cascading fashion. Currents are generated in the wires and are registered and processed using computers.”

WORK (t Hooft and Veltman): “According to modern physics, four fundamental forces exist in nature. Electromagnetic interaction is one of these. The weak interaction—responsible, for example, for the beta decay of nuclei—is another. In the 1960s, a unified theory was formulated for these two forces: the electroweak interaction. However, certain problems still remained to be solved. In the early 1970s, Gerardus t'Hooft and Martinus Veltman formulated and tested a mathematical theory that further explained the electroweak interaction.”

WORK (Englert and Higgs): “According to modern physics, matter consists of a set of particles that act as building blocks. Between these particles lie forces that are mediated by another set of particles. A fundamental property of the majority of particles is that they have a mass. Independently of one another, in 1964 both Peter Higgs and the team of François Englert and Robert Brout proposed a theory about the existence of a particle that explains why other particles have a mass. In 2012, two experiments conducted at the CERN laboratory confirmed the existence of the Higgs particle.”

**Ph2015** to Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald “for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass”.

WORK (Kajita): “The Standard Model used by modern physics has three types of a very small and elusive particle called the neutrino. In the Super-Kamiokande detector, an experimental facility in a mine in Japan in 1998, Takaaki Kajita detected neutrinos created in reactions between cosmic rays and the Earth’s atmosphere. Measurements showed deviations, which were explained by the neutrinos switching between the different types. This means that they must have mass. The Standard Model, however, is based on neutrinos lacking mass and the model must be revised.”

**Ph2020** to [Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose) “for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity” and to [Reinhard Genzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Genzel) and [Andrea Ghez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_M._Ghez) “for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy”.

WORK (Penrose): “A black hole is a supermassive compact object with a gravitational force so large that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. In 1964, Roger Penrose proposed critical mathematical tools to describe black holes. He showed that Einstein’s general theory of relativity means the formation of black holes must be seen as a natural process in the development of the universe. He was also able to describe black holes in detail: at their farthest depths is a singularity where all known laws of nature dissolve.”

Since the 1990s, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez with their respective research teams, have developed and refined techniques for studying the movement of stars. Observations of stars in the area around Sagittarius A* in the middle of our galaxy, the Milky Way, revealed a super massive black hole.”
