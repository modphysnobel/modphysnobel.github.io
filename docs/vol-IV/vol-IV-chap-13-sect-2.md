## 13.2. Steps in the development of Particle Physics.

Two steps correspond to developments of particle physics made in the period 1953 ‚Äì 2012: P1- Classification of elementary particles (1953-1964), and P2- Beyond the Standard model (1964-2012). We proceed as in the previous section on nuclear physics by including information taken from Nobel Prize documents and by presenting a timeline of experimental and theoretical developments in particle physics.

There is certain overlap between the closure of nuclear step N2 and the beginning of particle step P1. Altogether, the four steps of the development of high energy physics show the transitions from the study of the atomic models towards the discovery and use of nuclear properties and from them towards the understanding and classification of elementary particles. Such transitions imply significant changes in scales of energy, time, and size.

### P1 - Classification of elementary particles.

Experiments with elementary particles are quite difficult mainly for two reasons: such particles require very high energies to be produced and very complicated technological systems of apparatuses and installations need to be created and operated to observe and register their existence and interpret their behavior. Elementary particles are quite small in size and fast in movements; therefore, it is not possible to directly detect their motions. However, their trajectories can be followed when the particles leave some tracks while they pass through certain media. When the lifespan of the particles is extremely short there is no way to observe those tracks; the possibility is to register and afterwards to interpret instantaneous photographs of the reactions produced when those particles collide with other particles.

The eightfold way was proposed as an organizational scheme for classifying subatomic particles and antiparticles, including the development of the quark model. The assumption that physical laws are characterized by symmetry operations was questioned and the theory that the left-right symmetry law is violated by the weak interaction was confirmed. The main characteristics of the Standard model are the following:

- Experimental observed particles are composite of smaller building blocks called quarks. Particles are classified according to their symmetry properties.
- Nuclear forces maintain together protons and neutrons inside the atomic nucleus and are charge independent.
- Pi-mesons predicted form a triplet of particles that have nearly the same mass but different charges; they explain the interaction among nucleons.
- New particles heavier than the nucleons are produced when high-energy pi-mesons collide with nucleons. These particles form the group of baryons.
- Elementary particles can be transformed in others by the strong and the electromagnetic interactions only if the total hypercharge is conserved.
- The nucleons belong to a supermultiplet of eight particles (an octet). 

Elementary particles are fermions (they have half-integer spin) and constitute two families, light particles (leptons) and heavy particles (hadrons) formed by quarks. Quarks have charges that are fractions of the proton charge. Light particles form three families consisting of pairs of particles: the electron ($ùëí‚àí$) and the electron neutrino (ùúà_ùëí), the muon ($ùúá$) and the muon neutrino ($ùúà_ùúá$), and the tau ($ùúè$) and tau neutrino ($ùúà_ùúè$). Heavy particles (hadrons) are composed of mesons which are formed by quarks and antiquarks, and by baryons which are formed by combinations of three quarks. Quarks are of six types or flavors each one represented by the initial letter of its name; they form three generations of pairs: up ($ùë¢$) and down ($ùëë$), charmed ($ùëê$) and strange ($ùë†$), top ($ùë°$) and bottom ($ùëè$).

Bosons (have zero or integer spin) and correspond to four types of forces: the gravitational that is attractive and the electromagnetic that can be attractive or repulsive, the strong nuclear force that keeps protons and neutrons together inside the nucleus, and the weak nuclear force responsible for radioactivity and that affects particles such as neutrinos. The transformation of hydrogen into heavy hydrogen (deuterium) is caused by the weak force. The weak force makes a distinction between left and right; it has not the property of being reflection symmetric. The quanta that correspond to these four forces are all bosons: gravitons for the gravitational force, photons for the electromagnetic force, gluons for the strong nuclear force and particles $ùëä‚àí$, $ùëä+$ and $ùëç^0$ for the weak nuclear force.

‚Ä¢	In **1956** Chen Ning Yang (1922) and Tsung-Dao (T.D.) Lee (1926) proposed that the left-right symmetry law is violated by the weak interaction. This was in contradiction with the assumption that the same physical laws apply where right and left were reversed, and matter was replaced by antimatter.

‚Ä¢	In **1962** Leon M. Lederman (1922-2018), Melvin Schwartz (1932-2006) and Jack Steinberger (1921-2020) provided experimental evidence of the existence of a new type of neutrino, the muon neutrino.
	
‚Ä¢	In **1964** James Watson Cronin (1931-2016) and Val Logsdon Fitch (1923-2015) experimentally found that the matter-antimatter symmetry is violated when the neutral K-meson decays. They discovered that reactions going backward in time are not identical to those going forward meaning that there is an observed matter‚Äìantimatter asymmetry in the universe.

### P2 - Beyond the Standard model.

If natural laws are perfectly symmetrical and absolute, all the time they are valid throughout the entire universe. Three general principles of symmetry apply in physics: mirror symmetry (there is no difference between left and right), charge symmetry (antiparticles have the same properties but the opposite charge as the particles) and time symmetry (events are equally independent whether they occur forwards or backwards in time). These are respectively referred as P for parity, C for charge symmetry and T for time.

Symmetries simplify many calculations; they play a decisive role for the mathematical description of the microworld and implicate the application of conservation laws at the particle level. However, phenomena like the following have shown the need for considering broken symmetries. In the radioactive decay of kaon particles, a small fraction of them did not follow the current mirror and charge symmetries, they broke the double CP symmetry. In this case each kaon particle is a combination of a quark and an antiquark, and the weak force makes them switch identities: the quark becomes an antiquark while the antiquark becomes a quark.

A quantum field theory unifies the wave functions of quantum mechanics and the fields of electromagnetism. Electroweak interaction is understood as a relativistic quantum field theory where quantized fields are considered in terms of operators for the creation and annihilation of particles. The electroweak interaction refers to the unified treatment of electromagnetism and the weak force which underlies some forms of radioactivity, governs the decay of unstable subatomic particles such as mesons, and initiates the nuclear fusion reaction that fuels the Sun.

During the last fifty years several complex experimental projects have been planned and developed, showing results of consequences: the discovery of the W an Z quantized carriers of the weak interaction, the development of techniques for studying the movements of stars in the middle of the Milky Way revealing the existence of a super massive black hole, the discovery of neutrino oscillations, and the evidence about the existence of the boson Higgs serving to explain the masses of elementary particles.

The decay of the atom nucleus in the radioactive element cobalt 60 revealed that it did not follow the principles of mirror symmetry (the electrons that left the cobalt nucleus preferred one direction to another). In this case charge and mirror symmetries are broken separately, however, CP symmetry is conserved. Another spontaneous broken symmetry, the Higgs mechanism, destroyed the original symmetry between forces and gave the particles their masses in the very earliest stages of the universe.

The neutrino was a hypothetical particle introduced by Pauli in 1930 to explain the energy distribution of electrons emitted in the radioactive beta-decay process. Neutrinos are electrically neutral, weakly interacting and very light particles. There are six types of neutrinos: the electron neutrino and the positron neutrino, the muon neutrino and the antimuon neutrino, and the tau neutrino and the antitau neutrino. Neutrinos were detected and the existence of a fifth field created by the Higgs boson was proposed.

As all matter is transparent to neutrinos, to measure their action it was necessary first to produce them as a decay product of pi-mesons generated when accelerated protons collided with beryllium atoms. A special detector was built to observe the results of neutrino collisions with matter by registering produced muons in a spark chamber.

The Higgs boson is the mechanism by which mass originates in the universe: everything in it is immersed in an invisible field whose quantum is the Higgs boson. When a particle moves within this field there is some resistance to movement and the faster the movement the greater the resistance, thus implying that this quantitative measure of inertia, the mass, will be greater. Depending on the intensity of the interaction of a particle with the Higgs boson, so will be the magnitude of its mass. The Higgs boson cannot be detected directly, only its fingerprints, because the instant it is produced it disintegrates into other particles that are produced at very high energies.

The results of deep inelastic scattering of electrons on protons and bound neutrons served to confirm that these particles are composed of quarks. The mathematical structure of electroweak interaction was considered and the study of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons was formulated as Quantum Chromodynamics.

Relativistic considerations of the existence of black holes and theoretical explanations concerning symmetry violations were proposed. According to the theory of general relativity, stars containing large concentrations of masses warp space-time and generate gravitational forces. In the vicinity of this super-dense region, space-time is encapsulated, giving rise to a black hole. This process is called gravitational collapse whereby the black hole traps everything that approaches it and then prevents it from leaving, even if it is light.

Certain solutions of the equations of general relativity technically correspond to a singularity wrapped in a closed surface, which curves the space-time of four dimensions and thus delimits the so-called event horizon of the black hole. Such a singularity means that all the mass of the star is concentrated in a mathematical point, which by definition is dimensionless. The greater the mass of the black hole, the larger the size of its event horizon and therefore, the more intense the gravitational field that exists inside it. The black hole is not seen, we only perceive the imprint left by its presence.

‚Ä¢	In **1964** Fran√ßois Englert (1932) and Robert Brout (1928-2011) proposed independently of Peter W. Higgs (1929) a theory of how particles acquire mass.
	
‚Ä¢	In **1964**, Roger Penrose (1931) proposed critical mathematical tools to describe black holes. He showed that Einstein‚Äôs general theory of relativity means the formation of black holes and described black holes as a singularity where all known laws of nature dissolve.
	
‚Ä¢	In **1968** Georges Charpak (1924-2010) invented a multiwire proportional chamber for detecting very rare particle interactions. The entrance of particles in the chamber produced two effects: the liberation in cascade of electrons and the generation of currents in many thin, parallel wires arranged in a plane between two cathode planes.
	
‚Ä¢	Around **1970** Jerome I. Friedman (1930), Henry W. Kendall (1926-1999) and Richard E. Taylor (1929-2018) started a series of experiments with high-energy electrons colliding with protons and neutrons. Their results supported the theory that quarks are the building blocks of protons and neutrons and that the binding of them is due to the action of the bosons called gluons.
	
‚Ä¢	In the early **1970s**, Gerardus t'Hooft (1946) and Martinus J.G. Veltman (1931-2021) formulated and tested a mathematical theory that explained the quantum structure of electroweak interaction.

‚Ä¢	In **1973** David J. Gross (1941), H. David Politzer (1949) and Frank Wilczek (1951) postulated the existence of a property called asymptotic freedom. They proposed the mathematical framework called Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD): the theory of the strong interaction between quarks mediated by gluons.
	
‚Ä¢	In **1974** Burton Richter (1931-2018) and Samuel Chao Chung Ting (1936) independently of each other, discovered a new heavy particle (J/psi) and proved experimentally the existence of the fourth quark, the ‚Äúcharm‚Äù.
	
‚Ä¢	In a series of experiments from **1974** to **1977** Martin L. Perl (1927-2014) discovered a new particle‚Äîthe tau lepton. The experiments consisted in producing frontal collisions between electrons and their antiparticles, positrons.
	
‚Ä¢	Since **1980** Masatoshi Koshiba (1926-2020) measured the effects produced by neutrinos. When neutrinos pass through a tank of water inside a mine, they interact with atomic nuclei in the water and release an electron, creating small flashes of light to be detected by photomultipliers and then counted.
	
‚Ä¢	In **1983** Carlo Rubbia (1934) proposed and led experiments that, by allowing protons and antiprotons to collide at very high speeds, showed the existence of W and Z particles. Collaborating with him, Simon van der Meer (1925-2011) developed a method to accumulate a large number of energetic antiprotons in an accelerator ring. Rubbia developed the idea and van der Meer made it feasible.
	
‚Ä¢	Since the **1990s** and for almost thirty years, Reinhard Genzel (1952) and Andrea Ghez (1965) they have developed and refined techniques for mapping the orbits of the brightest stars that are closest to the center of our galaxy.
	
‚Ä¢	In **1998** Takaaki Kajita (1959) built the Super-Kamiokande detector in a mine in Japan and discovered that neutrinos switch their identities before arriving. Neutrinos have been created in reactions between cosmic rays and the Earth‚Äôs atmospheres; however, the measurements showed that up to two thirds of the calculated amount was missing. This was explained in terms of neutrinos oscillations whose existence might imply that neutrinos do have very small mass.
	
‚Ä¢	Since **2000** Arthur B. McDonald (1943) made measurements in a mine in Canada for studying neutrinos created in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Deviations in such measurements showed that in coming the neutrinos were having mid-flight metamorphosis switching between three different types. As the Standard Model is based on neutrinos lacking mass and the oscillation of neutrinos implies that they have mass, that model must be revised.
	
‚Ä¢	In **2012**, two experiments conducted at the CERN laboratory confirmed the existence of the Higgs particle. Two research groups of some 3,000 scientists each, managed to extract the Higgs particle from billions of particle collisions in the LHC (Large Hadron Collider).
