## 13.2. Steps in the development of Particle Physics.

Three steps (P1 – P3) describe the main developments of particle physics made in the period 1953 - 2012. Each one of these steps descriptions contains a timeline of selected contributions of Physics Nobel laureates. We indicate the year when the activities of the laureates were initiated not when the Nobel Prizes were awarded. More references to Physics Nobel Prizes concerning cosmological applications will be made in Chapter 14. Evolution of cosmology.

!!! info "Step P1- Classification of elementary particles and conservation laws." 

	The eightfold way was proposed as an organizational scheme for classifying subatomic particles and antiparticles, including the development of the quark model. The assumption that physical laws are characterized by symmetry operations was questioned and the theory that the left-right symmetry law is violated by the weak interaction was confirmed. Neutrinos were detected and the existence of a fifth field created by the Higgs boson was proposed.

	[P01] Gell-Mann classifies elementary particles and their interactions (1953).

	[P02] Segrè and Chamberlain confirm the existence of the antiproton (1955).

	[P03] Yang and Lee propose that left-right symmetry is violated in weak interactions (1956).

	[P04] Mössbauer investigates the inner structure of nuclei and nucleons (1958).

	[P05] Glashow, Salam and Weinberg explain the structure of the electroweak force (1960). 

	[P06] Davis detects neutrinos emitted from the Sun (1960).
	
	[P07] Giacconi starts studying emission of X-rays from stars and galaxies (1960).

	[P08] Nambu explains spontaneous symmetry violations (1960).

	[P09] Lederman, Schwartz and Steinberger discover the muon neutrino (1962).

	[P10] Cronin and Fitch found violations in matter-antimatter symmetry (1964).

	[P11] Englert, Brout and Higgs propose a theory of how particles acquire mass (1964).

!!! info "Step P2-Predictions and limitations of the Standard model." 
 
	Relativistic considerations of the existence of black holes and theoretical explanations concerning symmetry violations were proposed. Furthermore, the results of deep inelastic scattering of electrons on protons and bound neutrons served to confirm that these particles are composed of quarks. The mathematical structure of electroweak interaction was considered and the study of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons was formulated as Quantum Chromodynamics. 

	[P12] Penrose proposes mathematical tools for describing black holes (1964).
	
	[P13] Charpak invents a multiwire proportional chamber (1968).

	[P14] Friedman, Kendall and Taylor study collisions among high-energy electrons with protons and neutrons (1970).

	[P15] t'Hooft and Veltman explain the quantum structure of electroweak interaction (1970).

	[P16] Kobayashi and Maskawa explain the asymmetry in the decay of kaons (1972).

	[P17] Gross, Politzer and Wilczek develop Quantum ChromoDynamics (1973).
	
	[P18] Richter and Ting discover the J/psi particle and prove the existence of the charm quark (1974).

	[P19] Perl discovers the tau lepton (1974-1977).

!!! info "Step P3-Long time experimental projects."

	During the last fifty years several complex experimental projects have been planned and developed, showing results of consequences: the discovery of  the W an Z quantized carriers of the weak interaction, the development of techniques for studying the movements of stars in the middle of the Milky Way revealing the existence of a super massive black hole, the discovery of neutrino oscillations, and the evidence about the existence of the boson Higgs serving to explain the masses of elementary particles.
 
	[P21] Rubbia and van der Meer demonstrate the existence of W and Z particles (1983).

	[P22] Genzel and Ghez start mapping the orbits of stars to reveal the existence of a black hole (1990).

	[P23] Kajita discovers that neutrinos switch identities before arriving to Earth (1998).

	[P24] McDonald studies neutrinos created in nuclear reactions in the Sun (2000).

	[P25] Experiments conducted at the CERN confirm the existence of the Higgs particle (2012).
