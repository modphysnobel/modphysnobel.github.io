## 13.2. Particle physics.

It can be said that Modern Physics was born at the beginning of past century where classical physics were no more appropriate for understanding new phenomena. It implied the first steps in the building and testing of quantum physics, relativity physics and statistical physics. In what follows we consider the Nobel Prize contributions to the development of particle physics into three categories: experiments, instruments and theories.

The realization of experiments generated new discoveries and revolutionary explanations describing the characteristics of cosmic X-ray sources and the components of matter like electrons, antiprotons, neutrinos, quarks and many new elementary particles. 

Concerning instruments and devices, Nobel recognitions refereed to X-rays, the cyclotron, other particle accelerators and different types of chambers for registering particle tracks and visualizing high energy particle reactions.

The main theoretical contributions consisted in the introduction of the wave nature of particles, the exclusion principle, the existence of quarks and the relativistic descriptions of particle motions and interactions of matter with energy. It was needed also to integrate the weak and strong forces with electromagnetic interactions, to formulate the standard model and to demonstrate the existence of the Higgs boson and the presence of a black hole.

Table 13.2 describes the Physics Nobel Prizes awarded in the period from 1903 till 2020. We classify those Prizes into three categories: experiments awarded 12 times (marked in red), instruments awarded 5 times (marked in green) and theories awarded 13 times (marked in blue).  In two occasions the awarded prize included double contributions: in 1927 it referred to experimental work and development of instruments, and in 2020 to experimental work and theoretical treatments.

Next list does not include other awards mostly related to cosmology: pulsars, blackholes, microwave background radiation, accelerated expansion, neutrino oscillations, gravitational waves, exoplanets,  … All of them will be considered in next Chapter 14.

Next, for all these Nobel Prizes we describe first the year of the award and when each laureate started working on the issue that led to the award. Then, in most cases we briefly explain the basic physics content of the recognized work based on information contained in documents published in the Nobel Prize web page such as: *Award ceremony speech, Facts, Speed read, Press release. Popular information, and Advanced information.* The corresponding references are indicated for each Nobel Prize at the end of the Chapter. We follow the classification of particle physics Prizes in Experiments, Instruments and Theories.

### Experiments in particle physics.

**Ph-1906:** In 1897 Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940) showed that cathode rays consisted of particles that conduct electricity and were part of atoms: the electrons. 

Nobel Lecture: *Carriers of Negative Electricity* by Thomson.

**Ph-1923:** In 1910 Robert Andrews Millikan (1868-1953) determined the magnitude of the electron’s charge by experimenting with small electrically charged drops subjected to the downward force of gravity and the upward attraction of an electrical field. 

Nobel Lecture: *The Electron and the Light-Quant from the Experimental Point of View* by Millikan.

**Ph-1927:** In 1922 Arthur Holly Compton (1892-1962) directed X-ray photons onto a metal surface and observed that the X-rays’ wavelength increased because some of the incident photon energy was transferred to the electrons, confirming that electromagnetic radiation could be described as photon particles. 

Nobel Lecture: *X-rays as a Branch of Optics* by Compton.

Note:  For more details concerning the experiments made by Thomson, Millikan and Compton, see Volume I, Chapter 2. Production and control of electronic motions, Section 2.1. Regions for doing experiments and Section 2.2. Analysis of Physics Noble Prize Lectures.

**Ph-1937:** In 1927 Clinton Joseph Davisson (1881-1958) and George Paget Thomson (1892-1975) demonstrated, independently of one another, that electrons could be described as waves and present diffraction patterns.

Note:  For more details concerning the experiments made by Davisson and Germer and by Thomson, see Volume III, Waves, Chapter 9.  Matter waves and quantum mechanics principles, Section 9.1. From a theoretical proposition to an experimental demonstration.

**Ph-1968:** In 1950 Luis Walter Alvarez (1911-1988) introduced improvements in the bubble chamber by using liquid hydrogen and made new measurement systems and computer-based methods for analyzing large quantities of data of importance in the discovery of previously unknown fundamental particle resonances. 

Experiments with elementary particles are quite difficult mainly for two reasons: such particles require very high energies to be produced and a very complicated system needs to be created and operated to observe and register their existence and interpret their behavior. Elementary particles are quite small in size and fast in movements, therefore it is not possible to detect their motions; however, their trajectory can be followed when the particles leave some tracks while they pass through certain media. When the lifespan of the particles is extremely short there is no way to observe those tracks; the possibility is to register and afterwards to interpret instantaneous photographs of the reactions produced when those particles collide with other particles.

Nobel Lecture: *Recent Developments in Particle Physics* by Alvarez.

**Ph-1976:** In 1974 Burton Richter (1931-2018) and Samuel Chao Chung Ting (1936) independently of each other, discovered a new heavy particle (J/psi) and proved experimentally the existence of the fourth quark, the “charm”. 

The fourth quark was discovered in two different laboratories and with very different methods. Richter and his team from Stanford and Berkeley worked at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California. Ting and his team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. To give a name to the quark, the letter J was chosen at Brookhaven and the Greek letter ψ (psi) at Stanford.

Richter equipment was a sort of carousel (storage ring) where a stream of electrons and a stream of positrons go round in opposite directions. All the energy of the head-on collision gave rise to a motionless very heavy particle, which turned into several other particles by decay in a very short space interval of time.

In Ting’s experiment high-speed protons collided with a motionless target area of beryllium. Looking for finding a new heavy particle, the experiments had the purpose of investigating how twins of one electron and one positron were born at very high energies. 

Nobel Lectures: *From the Psi to Charm – The Experiments of 1975 and 1976* by Richter and *The Discovery of the J Particle: A Personal Recollection* by Ting.

**Ph-1980:** In 1964 James Watson Cronin (1931-2016) and Val Logsdon Fitch (1923-2015) experimentally found that the matter-antimatter symmetry is violated when the neutral K-meson decays. They discovered that reactions going backward in time are not identical to those going forward meaning that there is an observed matter–antimatter asymmetry in the universe. 
The experiments were made using the proton accelerator at the AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchroton) at Brookhaven National Laboratory where a beam of neutral elementary particles was produced and their radioactive decay in flight was recorded and measured. They choose to study neutral K-mesons which consists of one-half ordinary matter and the other half antimatter. What their results imply is that the left-right asymmetry is not always completely compensated by transforming from matter to antimatter.

Nobel Lectures: *CP Symmetry Violation – The Search for Its Origin* by Cronin and *The Discovery of Charge – Conjugation Parity Asymmetry* by Fitch.

**Ph-1984:** In 1983 Carlo Rubbia (1934) proposed and led experiments that, by allowing protons and antiprotons to collide at very high speeds, showed the existence of W and Z particles. Collaborating with him, Simon van der Meer (1925-2011) developed a method to accumulate a large number of energetic antiprotons in an accelerator ring. Rubbia developed the idea and van der Meer made it feasible. 

Nobel Lectures: *Experimental Observation of the Intermediate Vector Bosons* $W^+$, $W^–$ *and* $Z^0$ by Rubbia and *Stochastic Cooling and the Accumulation of Antiprotons* by van der Meer.

**Ph-1988:** In 1962 Leon M. Lederman (1922-2018), Melvin Schwartz (1932-2006) and Jack Steinberger (1921-2020) provided experimental evidence of the existence of a new type of neutrino, the muon neutrino. Their neutrino beam method has been used for the study of weak forces at high energies. 

As all matter is transparent to neutrinos, to measure their action it was necessary first to produce them as a decay product of pi-mesons generated when accelerated protons collided with beryllium atoms. A special detector was built to observe the results of neutrino collisions with matter by registering produced muons in a spark chamber. Neutrinos interact with matter only through the weak force.

Nobel Lectures: *Observations in Particle Physics from Two Neutrinos to the Standard Model* by Lederman, *The First High Energy Neutrino Experiment* by Schwartz, and *Experiments with High-Energy Neutrino Beams* by Steinberger.

**Ph-1990:** Around 1970 Jerome I. Friedman (1930), Henry W. Kendall (1926-1999) and Richard E. Taylor (1929-2018) started a series of experiments with high-energy electrons colliding with protons and neutrons. They were using a two-mile-long accelerator at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California. Their results supported the theory that quarks are the building blocks of protons and neutrons and that the binding of them is due to the action of the bosons called gluons. 

Nobel Lectures: *Deep Inelastic Scattering: Comparisons with the Quark Model* by Friedman, *Deep Inelastic Scattering: Experiments on the Proton and the Observation of Scaling* by Kendall and *Deep Inelastic Scattering: The Early Years* by Taylor.

**Ph-1995:** In a series of experiments from 1974 to 1977 Martin L. Perl (1927-2014) discovered a new particle—the tau lepton. The experiments consisted in producing frontal collisions between electrons and their antiparticles, positrons. The existence of the tau particle indicated the possibility of having a third family of elementary constituents of matter. 
The elementary particles are called fermions and are formed by three generations or families. The first family was established nearby 1960 as composed by the electron, the electron neutrino, and the up and down quarks. The second family was identified in 1974-76 as integrated by the muon, the muon neutrino and the charm and strange quarks. The new composed third family will be formed by the tau, the tau neutrino and the top and bottom quarks. The bottom quark was discovered in 1977; however, the top quark was found until 1994-1995.

Since 1950 Frederick Reines (1918-1998) in collaboration with Clyde Cowan (1919-1974) were experimenting with radiation coming from a nuclear reactor and discovered neutrinos. The neutrino was a hypothetical particle introduced by Pauli in 1930 to explain the energy distribution of electrons emitted in the radioactive beta-decay process. Neutrinos are electrically neutral, weakly interacting and very light particles. There are six types of neutrinos: the electron neutrino and the positron neutrino, the muon neutrino and the antimuon neutrino, and the tau neutrino and the antitau neutrino. 

Nobel Lectures: *Reflections on the Discovery of the Tau Lepton* by Perl and *The Neutrino: From Poltergeist to Particle* by Reines.

**Ph-2002:** In 1960 Raymond Davis Jr. (1914-2006) showed that the sun's energy originates from nuclear reactions in which hydrogen atoms combine with helium atoms to produce neutrinos. Inside a mine in South Dakota, USA a large tank contained around 390,000 liters of a chlorine-rich liquid was prepared to trap neutrinos emitted from the Sun. The interaction of chlorine atoms with neutrinos formed argon atoms and by counting them the presence of neutrinos could be proved; those argon atoms are radioactive and have a lifetime of about 50 days. 

Since 1980 Masatoshi Koshiba (1926-2020) took measurements inside another enormous tank of 50,000-tonnes of water inside a mine in Japon. When neutrinos pass through this tank, they may interact with atomic nuclei in the water. This reaction leads to the release of an electron, creating small flashes of light to be detected by photomultipliers and then counted. 

Beginning 1960 Riccardo Giacconi (1931-2018) started studying emission of X-rays from stars and galaxies by means of telescopes in satellites. He constructed instruments and discovered X-ray sources outside our own solar system, cosmic background radiation with X-ray wavelengths as well as X-ray sources that probably contain black holes. 

Nobel Lectures: *A Half-Century with Solar Neutrinos* by Davis, *Birth of Neutrino Astrophysics* by Koshiba, and *The Dawn of X-Ray Astronomy* by Giacconi.

**Ph-2015:** Takaaki Kajita (1959) built the Super-Kamiokande detector in a mine in Japan and there in 1998 he discovered that neutrinos switch their identities before arriving. Neutrinos have been created in reactions between cosmic rays and the Earth’s atmospheres; however, the measurements showed that up to two thirds of the calculated amount was missing. This was explained in terms of neutrinos oscillations whose existence might imply that neutrinos do have very small mass. 

Since 2000 Arthur B. McDonald (1943) made measurements in a mine in Canada for studying neutrinos created in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Deviations in such measurements showed that in coming the neutrinos were having mid-flight metamorphosis switching between three different types. Although the Sun only produces electron-neutrinos some of them were not detected on traveling to Earth. As the Standard Model is based on neutrinos lacking mass and the oscillation of neutrinos implies that they have mass, that model must be revised. 

Nobel Lectures: *Discovery of Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillations* by Kajita and *The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory: Observation of Flavor Change for Solar Neutrinos* by McDonald.

**Ph-2020:** Since the 1990s, Reinhard Genzel (1952) and Andrea Ghez (1965) and for almost thirty years they have developed and refined techniques for mapping the orbits of the brightest stars that are closest to the center of our galaxy. 

They measured the positions and travel speeds of distant stars in the area around a source of high-intensity radio waves called Sagittarius A*. The star called S2 or S-O2 completes an elliptical orbit with respect to the center of the galaxy in less than 16 years. By measuring radial velocities of S2 as it approached and moved away from the center of the galaxy, astrophysicists realized that the cause of that effect could be none other than a black hole in Sagittarius A*. This was the evidence that a super massive black hole was produced with a mass equivalent to around 4 million solar masses when a massive star collapsed under its own gravity.

### Instruments in particle physics.

**Ph-1901:** Around 1895 Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845-1923) discovered X-rays when he was experimenting with a Crookes tube. This tube consisted of a partially evacuated glass bulb, with two metal electrodes, the cathode and the anode. When a high voltage is was applied between the electrodes, cathode rays (electrons) were projected in straight lines from the cathode. Although the apparatus was screened off, Röntgen noticed that a faint light was registered on a light-sensitive screen. This type of radiation, the X-ray, was generated because fast-moving electrons suddenly decelerated during their collision  and interaction with the target anode. No Nobel Lecture was delivered.

**Ph-1927:** In 1911 Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869-1959) constructed a cloud chamber which was a glass container with air and water vapor; an increase in the volume of this mixture of air and water vapor produced small water drops. If the air contained electrically charged particles—ions—then the droplets were formed around these charges. The traces left by ionizing radiation and particles that pass through the chamber become visible to be photographed.

Nobel Lecture: *On the Cloud Method of Making Visible Ions and the Tracks of Ionizing Particles* by Wilson.
 
**Ph-1939:** In 1929 Ernest Orlando Lawrence (1901- 1958) started thinking in the construction of a cyclotron for accelerating protons to high velocities. He applied a method called magnetic resonance acceleration by combining a constant homogeneous magnetic field and an oscillating electrical field with constant frequency. The charged particles moved in orbits with ever-increasing radii through stepwise acceleration in a spiral-shaped path before they collide with specific targets to penetrate atomic nucleus and produce nuclear reactions. He obtained a patent of this machine in 1934. The cyclotron has been also used in the production of artificially radioactive substances. 

Nobel Lecture: *The Evolution of the Cyclotron* by Lawrence.

**Ph-1960:** In 1952 Donald Arthur Glaser (1926-2013) invented the bubble chamber as an instrument for observing the tracks produced by charged particles when they pass through a chamber filled with a liquid at near-boiling point. When the pressure inside the chamber was reduced, strings of bubbles were formed around these charged atoms and afterwards their corresponding tracks were photographed and analyzed. 

Nobel Lecture: *Elementary Particles and Bubble Chambers* by Glaser.

**Ph-1992:** In 1968 Georges Charpak (1924-2010) invented a multiwire proportional chamber for detecting very rare particle interactions. The entrance of particles in the chamber produced two effects: the liberation in cascade of electrons and the generation of currents in a large number of thin, parallel wires arranged in a plane between two cathode planes. Afterwards, these currents were registered, amplified, and processed using computers directly connected with the detectors. 

Nobel Lecture: *Electronic Imaging of Ionizing Radiation with Limited Avalanches in Gases* by Charpak.

### Theories in particle physics.

**Ph-1929:** In 1924 Prince Louis-Victor Pierre Raymond de Broglie (1892-1987) proposed that electrons could be understood both as particles and as waves, meaning that particles have an associated wave function describing their propagation and interactions. 

Nobel Lecture: *The Wave Nature of the Electron* by de Broglie.

Note:  For more details concerning the De Broglie hypotheses and the diffraction of electrons experiments made by Davisson and Germer and by Thomson, see Volume III, Waves, Chapter 9.  Matter waves and quantum mechanics principles, Section 9.1. From a theoretical proposition to an experimental demonstration.

**Ph-1945:** In 1925 Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) formulated the exclusion principle, which implies that no two electrons in an atom could have identical sets of quantum numbers. 

Nobel Lecture: *Exclusion Principle and Quantum Mechanics* by Pauli.

Note:  For more details concerning Pauli exclusion principle see Volume I. Motion, Chapter 1. Dictatorial and democratic conceptualizations of spaces. Section 1.2.  Conceptualizations of spaces and quantum statistics.

**Ph-1957:** In 1956 Chen Ning Yang (1922) and Tsung-Dao (T.D.) Lee (1926) proposed that the left-right symmetry law is violated by the weak interaction. This was in contradiction with the assumption that the same physical laws apply where right and left were reversed and matter was replaced by antimatter. 

Nobel Lectures: *The Law of Parity Conservation and Other Symmetry Laws of Physics* by Yang and *Weak Interactions and Nonconservation of Parity* by Lee.

**Ph-1965:** In 1948 Sin-Itiro Tomonaga (1906-1979), Julian Schwinger (1918-1994) and Richard P. Feynman (1918-1988); they were recognized "for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles". This theory is a quantum and relativistic explication of the interaction of charged particles and the electromagnetic field; in particular it implies the renormalization of the mass and the charge of the electrons. Through a renormalization procedure Tomonga interpreted the splitting of degenerated energy levels within the hydrogen atom (the Lamb shift). Schwinger also through a renormalization procedure reformulated the theory to explain that he electron’s magnetic moment proved to be somewhat larger than expected. Feynman created a new version of quantum electrodynamics introducing graphical procedure for the calculation of interaction probabilities (the Feynman diagrams).

**Ph-1969:** In 1953 Murray Gell-Mann (1929-2019) published the first of a series of papers indicating how to classify the elementary particles and their interactions (the Eightfold Way). The main characteristics of this model are the following: 

•	Experimental observed particles are composite of smaller building blocks called quarks. Particles are classified according to their symmetry properties.

•	Nuclear forces maintain together protons and neutrons inside the atomic nucleus and are charge independent.

•	Pi-mesons predicted by Yukawa form a triplet of particles that have nearly the same mass but different charges; they explain the interaction among nucleons.

•	New particles heavier than the nucleons are produced when high-energy pi-mesons collide with nucleons. These particles form the group of baryons.

•	Elementary particles can be transformed in others by the strong and the electromagnetic interactions only if the total hypercharge is conserved. This new concept is defined as twice the mean value of the charges in the multiplets formed by baryons.

•	The nucleons belong to a supermultiplet of eight particles (an octet).  All particles are composed of only three kinds of particles: the quarks and of the corresponding antiparticles. Quarks have charges that are fractions of the proton charge. 

Nobel Lecture: *Symmetry and Currents in Particle Physics* by Gell-Man (no manuscript was available).

**Ph-1979:** In 1960 Sheldon Lee Glashow (1932), Abdus Salam (1926-1996) and Steven Weinberg (1933-2021) independently developed a theory in which the new concept of the electroweak force was introduced. They have been recognized “for their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current”. 

Elementary particles are fermions (they have half-integer spin) and constitute two families, light particles (leptons) and heavy particles (hadrons) formed by quarks. Light particles form three families consisting of pairs of particles: the electron ($e-$) and the electron neutrino ($ν_e$), the muon ($μ$) and the muon neutrino ($ν_μ$), and the tau ($τ$) and tau neutrino ($ν_τ$). Heavy particles (hadrons) are composed of mesons which are formed by quarks and antiquarks, and by baryons which are formed by combinations of three quarks.

Quarks are of six types or flavors each represented by the initial letter of its name; they form three generations of pairs: up (u) and down (d), charmed (c) and strange (s), top (t) and bottom (b). The triples of quarks that constitute protons and neutrons are, respectively, (uud) and (udd). In addition, for each quark there exists its corresponding antiquark in a somewhat analogous way that for the electron there exists its antielectron (a positively charged electron), the positron.

Bosons (have zero or integer spin) and correspond to four types of forces: the gravitational that is of attraction and the electromagnetic that can be of attraction or repulsion, the strong nuclear force that keeps protons and neutrons together inside the nucleus, and the weak nuclear force responsible for radioactivity and that affects particles such as neutrinos. The transformation of hydrogen into heavy hydrogen (deuterium), is caused by the weak force. The weak force makes a distinction between left and right; it has not the property of being reflection symmetric. The quanta that correspond to these four forces are boson: gravitons for the gravitational force, photons for the electromagnetic force, gluons for the strong nuclear force and particles $W^-$, $W^+$ and $Z^0$ for the weak nuclear force.

**Ph-1999:** In the early 1970s, Gerardus t'Hooft (1946) and Martinus J.G. Veltman (1931-2021) formulated and tested a mathematical theory that explained the quantum structure of electroweak interaction.   

A quantum field theory unifies the wave functions of quantum mechanics and the fields of electromagnetism. Electroweak interaction is understood as a relativistic quantum field theory where quantized fields are considered in terms of operators for the creation and annihilation of particles. The electroweak interaction refers to the unified treatment of electromagnetism and the weak force which underlies some forms of radioactivity, governs the decay of unstable subatomic particles such as mesons, and initiates the nuclear fusion reaction that fuels the Sun. The electroweak force is mediated by four exchange particles: the mass-less photon and the three field particles W+, W – and Z0.

**Ph-2004:** In 1973 David J. Gross (1941), H. David Politzer (1949) and Frank Wilczek (1951) postulated the existence of a property called asymptotic freedom. For explaining this property, they proposed the mathematical framework called *Quantum ChromoDynamics* (QCD): the theory of the strong interaction between quarks mediated by gluons. 

The exchange of force between protons and neutrons in the nucleus occurs through interactions between quarks. This is the strong force that holds together the quarks and make up protons and neutrons. It has not been possible to detect free quarks; they must form aggregates. Each quark, in addition to have an electric charge which are a fraction of the proton’s, also have a special property called color charge (red, blue, or green). Gluons are the carriers of the interactions between quarks and have also the property of color charge; gluons interact not only with quarks but also with each other. The property of asymptotic freedom is manifested when at high energies quarks are very close and behave like free particles because quark color charge is weaker.

**Ph-2008:** In 1960, Yoichiro Nambu (1921-2015) formulated a mathematical theory for understanding spontaneous symmetry violations in subatomic physics. In 1972, Makoto Kobayashi (1944) and Toshihide Maskawa (1940-2021) provided a mathematics-based explanation of the discovery that the decay of certain particles (kaons) was asymmetrical. 

If natural laws are perfectly symmetrical and absolute, all the time they are valid throughout the entire universe. Three general principles of symmetry apply in physics: mirror symmetry (there is no difference between left and right), charge symmetry (antiparticles have exactly the same properties but the opposite charge as the particles) and time symmetry (events are equally independent whether they occur forwards or backwards in time). These are respectively referred as P for parity, C for charge symmetry and T for time. 

Symmetries simplify many calculations; they play a decisive role for the mathematical description of the microworld and implicate a large number of conservation laws at the particle level. However, phenomena like the following have shown the need for considering broken symmetries: 

•	The decay of the atom nucleus in the radioactive element cobalt 60 revealed that it did not follow the principles of mirror symmetry (the electrons that left the cobalt nucleus preferred one direction to another). In this case charge and mirror symmetries are broken separately, however, CP symmetry is conserved. 

•	In the radioactive decay of kaon particles, a small fraction of them did not follow the current mirror and charge symmetries, they broke the double CP symmetry. In this case each kaon particle is a combination of a quark and an antiquark and the weak force makes them switch identities: the quark becomes an antiquark while the antiquark becomes a quark.

•	Another spontaneous broken symmetry, the Higgs mechanism, destroyed the original symmetry between forces and gave the particles their masses in the very earliest stages of the universe.

**Ph-2013:** In 1964 François Englert (1932) and Robert Brout (1928-2011) and Peter W. Higgs (1929) proposed independently the theory of how particles acquire mass. In 2012, two experiments conducted at the CERN laboratory confirmed the existence of the Higgs particle. 

The Higgs boson is the mechanism by which mass originates in the universe: everything in it is immersed in an invisible field whose quantum is the Higgs boson. When a particle moves within this field there is some resistance to movement and the faster the movement the greater the resistance, thus implying that this quantitative measure of inertia, the mass, will be greater. Depending on the intensity of the interaction of a particle with the Higgs boson, so will be the magnitude of its mass. The Higgs boson cannot be detected directly, only its fingerprints, because the instant it is produced it disintegrates into other particles that are produced at very high energies.

**Ph-2020:** In 1964, Roger Penrose (1931) proposed critical mathematical tools to describe black holes. He showed that Einstein’s general theory of relativity means the formation of black holes and described black holes in detail: at their farthest depths is a singularity where all known laws of nature dissolve. 

According to the theory of general relativity, stars containing large concentrations of masses warp space-time and generate gravitational forces. In the vicinity of this super-dense region, space-time is encapsulated, giving rise to a black hole. This process is called gravitational collapse whereby the black hole traps everything that approaches it and then prevents it from leaving, even if it is light.

Certain solutions of the equations of general relativity technically correspond to a singularity wrapped in a closed surface, which curves the space-time of four dimensions and thus delimits the so-called event horizon of the black hole. Such a singularity means that all the mass of the star is concentrated in a mathematical point, which by definition is dimensionless. The greater the mass of the black hole, the larger the size of its event horizon and therefore, the more intense the gravitational field that exists inside it. The black hole is not seen, we only perceive the imprint left by its presence.
