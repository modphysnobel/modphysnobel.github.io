#### Section 4.1.  On Euclidean geometry and non-Euclidean geometries.

We consider in Section 4.1 the contributions to the geometrical understanding of space due to Euclid and by the creators of non-Euclidean geometries like Gauss, Lobachesvsky, Bolyai, and Riemann. Afterwards we describe an explanation attributed to Joseph Louis Lagrange who applied the mechanical principle of the lever to show that Euclid´s fifth postulate of the parallels is satisfied. Next, we deal with the lever principle in connection with those natural states of motion: uniform translation, uniform accelerated translation, and uniform rotation. Each one of these cases is related to a conservation law, respectively to: the linear momentum in collisions, the kinetic energy in falling bodies, and the angular momentum in equilibrium levers.

#### Section 4.2.  Einstein´s theories of relativity.

We refer to Einstein´s theories of relativity and comment on his Nobel Lecture presented in 1922: *Fundamental ideas and problems of the theory of relativity*. . Nevertheless, he was awarded in 1921 with the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".

#### Section 4.3.  Aspects and Factors distinguishing scientific theories.

Finally in Section 4.3 we consider the process *Aspects and Factors distinguishing scientific theories* and apply it to the descriptions of motion as proposed by Kepler, Galileo, Newton and Einstein.

## 4.1.  On Euclidean geometry and non-Euclidean geometries.

Euclid (323-285 a.C) organized the mathematical knowledge understood in his time and created a closed, complete and consistent system for the axiomatic construction of theorems, which are logically derived from definitions and five assumptions, also called postulates or axioms. Going from the simple towards the complex, his work *Elements* characterized a method of proposition, diagrammatic illustration, prove, and conclusion. His systematic and well-organized demonstrations constitute a classical manual for learning geometry that has been used during many centuries. 

The Euclidean world corresponds to flat regions of the geometrical space where the curvature is null and when only one parallel line can be drawn from a point external to a given straight line. That line can be extended to infinite in both directions; consequently, the distance separating the two parallel lines remains constant. This geometry is called parabolic, it considers a space of null curvature and the sum of the interior angles in a triangle is exactly equal to 180°. Euclid’s five postulates are next indicated:

1. To draw a straight line from any point to any point.
2. To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.
3. To describe a circle with any center and distance.
4. That all right angles are equal to one another.
5. That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.

The first three postulates deal with the possibilities for building straight lines and circles and affirm that such geometrical figures exist. The first four postulates have been considered as self-evident. However, the fifth postulate implies implicitly that space is infinite when the parallel straight lines are extended without limitation in both directions.  

### *Alternative versions to the fifth Euclidean postulate*

Some efforts have been dedicated to change the fifth postulate into a more satisfactory form or even to derive it from the other four postulates. For instance, alternative versions of the fifth postulate have been proposed in next publications:

- In 1795 by John Playfair (1748-1819) published *Elements of geometry* where the so called Playfair´s axiom is presented.

- In 1794 by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) published *Éléments de géométrie* where he demonstrated that if the three internal angles of a planar triangle add to 180° then it follows the fifth postulate.

- In 1899 by David Hilbert (1862-1943) published *Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundations of geometry)* where he proposed a set of 21 axioms that includes the parallel postulate. By using the axiomatic method, he wanted to develop the required tools for solving any mathematical problem. He worked also on the general theory of relativity. 

According to Reichenbach (1958), in Euclidean geometry the theorems were known first, and the axiomatic foundation was developed later. Nevertheless, by following a sort of contradictory procedure, in non-Euclidean geometries the axiomatic constructions were the instruments for the discovery of geometrical proofs. Such a contradiction was a consequence of the required self-consistent reformulations of the fifth postulate of the parallels. 

Two non-Euclidean geometries can be considered depending on the curvature of the space and therefore, the corresponding number of parallel lines will be different than just one when the curvature is zero: it is infinite when the curvature is negative as in hyperbolic geometry where the lines never intersect (all the lines are parallel), or it is null when the curvature is positive as in elliptic geometry where all the lines converge (there are no parallel lines). In non-Euclidean geometries the internal angles of a triangle do not add exactly to 180° (Figure 4.1).

**Figure 4.1.**  Geometric properties of surfaces of different curvature.

It is not clear who was the first mathematician writing about non-Euclidean geometries. The merit is shared by next four mathematicians:
 
Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855): in two letters to friends published in 1816 and in 1822 as well as in some notes written in 1831 he referred to a geometry called by him as antiEucledean, astral or non-Euclidean. 

Nikolái Ivánovich Lobachevski (1792-1856): he wrote about imaginary geometry in these publications: *On the Origin of Geometry* (1829-1830), *New Principles of Geometry with Complete Theory of Parallels* (1835-1837), *Geometrical Researches on the Theory of Parallels* (1840) and *Pangeometry* (1855).

János Bolyai (1802-1860) named his geometry as absolute in his essay written in 1825 *The science of absolute space*, which was published as an appendix in a book edited by his father Wolfgang Farkas Bolyai (1775 - 1856). This work was called *“Tentamen Juventutem Studiosam in Elementa Matheseos" (Essays on mathematical elements for young students)* and was published until 1832-1833.

Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866): there are indications that in 1854 Gauss proposed to Riemann the following theme for his dissertation *Ueber die Hypothesen, Welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen (On the Hypotheses on which Geometry is Based)*. In that thesis Riemann dealt with the relation between geometry and the world where we live in.  He demonstrated that Euclid axioms were of empirical nature and not self-evident truths.

The hyperbolic geometry was developed by Gauss, Bolyai and Lobachebsky, and the elliptic geometry was worked out by Riemann. Such approach was used by Einstein because for the formulation of the general relativity theory he required that the geometrical characterizations of space were not unique and local as in the Euclidean space.

### The lever principle and the fifth parallel postulate.

Archimedes considered that mechanical experiments could be used to extend geometric knowledge and he dedicated many efforts to build mechanisms to capture the principles of their operation. He contributed both to the development of technological applications and to an incipient mathematization of physics. Unlike Aristotle, Archimedes used geometric arguments to make demonstrations about physical situations; he was the first to mathematically demonstrate the law of the lever by reasoning and not by experimenting. 

Archimedes stated his law as follows: “commensurable magnitudes will balance at distances inversely proportional to their gravities”. The phrase *“Pa bo, kai tan gan kino”* is attributed to Archimedes, which in the Doric dialect spoken in Syracuse means *“Give me a foothold and I will move the world”*. The proof of this principle is presented below. 

Consider a mechanical system made up of two bodies A and B of unequal masses mA and mB joined by a linear bar of zero mass and with the possibility of rotating about a turning point C (Figure 4.2). Since the masses are under the action of the same gravitational field, the points of suspension of the masses experience a downward vertical force corresponding to their weights $P_A$ and $P_B$ with magnitudes $[P_A] = m_Ag$ and $[P_B] = m_Bg$, where $g$ is the constant of gravitational attraction.

**Figure 4.2.** Diagram of distances and weights on the lever.

The distances from each mass to the center of rotation C are measured in the horizontal direction and correspond to the magnitudes $d_A$ and $d_B$, while the weights act in the vertical direction along lines that are parallel to each other. 

The forces $P$ acting on the ends of the lever produce torques $τ = r \times P$. The magnitude of these vectors is $[τ] = [r][P](sin θ)$ where $θ$ is the angle between the vectors $r$ and $P$; $r$ is the vector that joins the center C with the point where each weight $P$ is applied. As can be seen in Figure 4.3, the angle $θ$ is 90° for each weight. The rotations produced by each torque are usually assigned a sign that is positive for the clockwise rotation of the mass $m_B: [τ_B] = (+)[d_B][P_B]$, while it is negative for the leftward rotation of the mass $m_A: [τ_A] = (-)[d_A][P_A]$. 

When the complete mechanical system is in equilibrium- the lever does not turn and do not translate- the resulting torque is null and $[τ_A] + [τ_B] = 0$. Then $(-)[d_A][P_A] (+)[d_B][P_B] = 0$, From this, the principle of the lever indicates that the products of the distances of the masses $m_A$ and $m_B$ to the center of balance C multiplied by the magnitude of the corresponding weights are equal for both bodies:

$d_AP_A = d_BP_B$

</blockquote>

As in any mathematical approach involving geometric figures, it will be assumed that lines and points have no mass and their dimensions are one and zero, respectively. Furthermore, the lever principle applies only in a plane and not on surfaces with non-zero curvature.

The explanation that the lever principle serves to justify that the parallel postulate is satisfied is contained in an annex of the book *Non-Euclidean Geometries: Historical-Critical Exposure of its Development*, published by Roberto Bonola (1874-1911) in 1912. According to Bonola, this explanation, which is not a demonstration, was made by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) and was published in volume XI of his complete works. This work was commented in a publication by Pepe, L. and Borgato, M. T.: *Una memoria inedita di Lagrange sulla teoria delle parallele*. Boll. Storia Sci. Mat. 8(2),307–335 (1988).

In what follows we describe the explanation made by Lagrange. Figure 4.3 expresses the content of Euclid's fifth postulate and figures 4.4 to 4.7 correspond to the explanation attributed to Lagrange.

<img src="./figs/Vol-I-chap-4-sect-1-Fig4.PNG" width=600 align=center>

**Figure 4.3.** The two lines are parallel only when α + β = 180º.

Lagrange's triangle consists in the following (Figure 4.4):

Let ABC be an isosceles triangle whose sides AB and AC are equal by construction.

Line AD is perpendicular to side BC and intersects this side at point D, which is in the middle of segment BC, that is, BD = DC.

Points M and N are in the middle of respective sides AB and AC so that BM = MA in one side and AN = NC in the other side.

<img src="./figs/Vol-I-chap-4-sect-1-Fig5.PNG" width=300 align=center>

**Figure 4.4.** Characteristics of the triangle ABC, the so-called Lagrange’s triangle.

Now consider that Lagrange's triangle is suspended from point A and that a weight 2P is applied to point A and a weight P is applied to each endpoint B and C, as shown in Figure 4.6. Under such conditions, the triangle BAC is in equilibrium with respect to the axis that passes through the line AD: the weight 2P in A does not intervene because it is at a zero distance from the axis AD. The weights that hang from B and C satisfy the condition of the lever:

Suspension point in A: (P) x (BD) {left side of D} = (P) x (DC) {right side of D}.

<img src="./figs/Vol-I-chap-4-sect-1-Fig6.PNG" width=300 align=center>

**Figure 4.5.** Application of the principle of the lever when the suspension is in A: (P) x (BD) = (P) x (DC).

Now consider that the weight 2P that was hanging at A is divided in two parts: a weight P is applied at point A to a lever to be suspended from the point M (which is in the middle of segment BA) and the other weight P is applied at that same point A but to the lever that is suspended from point N (which is in the middle of segment AC) (Figures 4.6a and 4.6b). Under these conditions we obtain 

Suspension in M: (BM x P) {left side of M} = (MA x P) {right side of M}.

Suspension in N: (AN x P) {left side of N} = (NC x P) {right side of N}.

<img src="./figs/Vol-I-chap-4-sect-1-Fig7.PNG" width=600 align=center>

**Figure 4.6.** Levers with suspension centers in M (a) and in N (b).

Then suppose that the weights on B and A in Figure 4.6a are applied to M and the weights on A and C in Figure 4.6b are applied to N. Superposing these two conditions, we have in the triangle ABC that each one of the weights on M and on N are 2P. The aforementioned distribution of weights also maintains the balance of triangle ABC with respect to an axis passing through points M, E, and N. This is shown in Figure 4.8 where the triangle is placed vertically and suspended from point E, which is the intersection of line AD. with the line MN.

<img src="./figs/Vol-I-chap-4-sect-1-Fig8.PNG" width=300 align=center>

**Figure 4.7.** Redistribution of the weight on M and on N corresponding to the superpositions of previous figures 4.6a and 4.6b. Now the triangle ABC is suspended from E.

The situation of the triangle ABC in a vertical position and in equilibrium with respect to the suspension point E is equivalent to a lever along the axis MN, with center in E and with weights equal to 2P on each side. If the distances from the center E to the ends M and N are $d_1 = ME$ y $d_2 = EN$. Applying the principle of the lever, we obtain:

Suspension in E: (ME x 2P) {left side of E} = (EN x 2P) {right side of E}.

Since the above condition is satisfied because the lever is in equilibrium, we get ME = EN and therefore E is the midpoint of the segment MN. Under these conditions, the line AD, which is perpendicular to the line BC because it bisects the angle BAC, is also perpendicular to the line MN at point E. This implies the equality between the angles DEM = DEN and ADB = ADC, all of them having 90° which indicates that lines MN and BC are parallel to each other.

The previous affirmation is identified with the fifth postulate of parallels, which indicates that the sum of the angles α = NED and β = CDE is two right angles, each of these angles being equal to 90° and that therefore $α + β = 180°$. This means that the static equilibrium in Lagrange's triangle is explained in terms of the lever principle, showing that the applicability of such a principle justifies Euclid's parallel postulate. Certainly, this implies that the lever principle is applicable only in flat spaces of zero curvature corresponding to Euclidean spaces.

### Conservation laws about linear momentun, kinetic energy and angular momentum.

Following Don Juan Bautista de Oyarzabal Orueta (1913-1977) we connect the principle of the lever with what Galileo called the three natural states of bodies in motion: *(1) the uniform movement of bodies on Earth, (2) the uniformly accelerated motion of bodies falling from heaven to Earth, and (3) the circular motion of the stars in the sky*. We concentrate on the first two states, since the third natural state of bodies in motion refers to celestial bodies.

**First natural state of bodies in motion**: the uniform translational motion of bodies on Earth.

Consider the collision between two bodies approaching in a straight line with constant velocities: body A with mass $m_A$ and velocity $v_A$ and body B with mass $m_B$ and velocity $v_B$. (We omit the vector notation since the motion is uniform and in a straight line.)

As the linear momentum is defined as the product of the mass and the velocity, so that the linear momentum of the total system is $m_Av_A + m_Bv_B$. If before the collision $v_B = 0$ and after the collision $v_A = 0$, the conservation of linear momentum implies that before the collision we have $m_Av_A+0 = m_Av_A$, and after the collision $0 + m_Bv_B = m_Bv_B$. Therefore $m_Av_A = m_Bv_B$.

The conservation of linear momentum ($p_{total}$) is a consequence of the fact that the resultant of the forces is zero: if $F_{resultant} =  \frac{d(p_{total})}{dt}=0$, then $p_{total}$  is constant.

Next, we make two substitutions in the relation expressing the conservation of linear momentum: $m_Av_A = m_Bv_B$. In the first substitution each mass is indicated as the quotient of the weight divided by the acceleration of gravity (g): $m_A = p_A/g$ y $m_B = p_B/g$. For the second substitution we consider that the movement is rectilinear and uniform and that each velocity is the quotient of the distance traveled divided by the time used to cover it. If the times are equal $t_A = t_B = t$, then $v_A = d_A/t$ y $v_B = d_B/t$. For body A: $m_Av_A = (p_A/g)(d_A/t) = (p_Ad_A)/(gt)$ and for body B: $m_Bv_B = (p_Bd_B)/(gt)$. Equating the total linear moments and simplifying the common factor (gt) the well-known lever principle $p_Ad_A = p_Bd_B$ is obtained.

CONCLUSION 1

The first natural state of bodies in motion is the uniform motion of translation of bodies on Earth. The case of a collision between two bodies is analyzed: before the collision one of the bodies is at rest and after the collision the other body remains at rest.

If the sum of the external forces on the system of the two colliding bodies is zero, then the total linear momentum before and after the collision is conserved. Under such conditions, the expression corresponding to the principle of the lever can be obtained.

**Second natural state of bodies in motion**: the uniformly accelerated motion of
bodies falling from heaven to Earth.

This case deals with the free fall of two bodies that are at different heights from the ground: body A is at height $h_A$, while body B is at height $h_B$. According to Galileo, the height of the free fall of these bodies depends on the square of the velocity and on the acceleration of gravity (g): $h_A = (v_A)^2/(2g)$ and $h_B = (v_B)^2/(2g)$. 

Previous equations are based on the following: 

1. The movement of free fall is rectilinear.

In this movement, the object that is released from a certain height (h) and is allowed to fall without pushing it, at first has zero initial velocity ($v_{initial} = 0$) and when it falls it follows a rectilinear trajectory that corresponds to the vertical, if there is no air friction. However, such movement does not correspond to a uniform velocity because this physical quantity changes with time due to the action of the acceleration of gravity that causes the speed of fall to increase with time. When the object reaches the ground in a fall time ($t_c$) it will have reached the velocity $v_{final} = gt_c$.

2.  Free fall motion is not uniform but uniformly accelerated.

If the initial point from which the displacements are measured corresponds to the place from where the object is dropped out, the distance traveled will be the height (h) from which it is released. If the movement were uniform with velocity $v_{constant}$, the distance traveled (h) would depend linearly on time $h = (v_{constant})(t)$. However, since there is an acceleration that modifies the initial velocity, the distance traveled is $h = (v_{average})(t)$ where $v_{average} = (½)(v_{initial} + v_{final})$ is the average velocity. Then, as $v_{initial} = 0$, it results $v_{average} = (½)(v_{final})$.

As in the previous case $v_{final} = gt$, therefore $h = (v_{average})(t) = ½(v_{final})(t) = ½(gt^2)$. Solving for time in $v_{final} = gt$ and substituting into the previous expression $h = (½)(gt^2)$ it can be obtained $h = (½)(g)(v/g)^2 = (v^2)/(2g)$. This allows us to write that in the case of free fall of bodies A and B we have $h_A = (v_A)^2/(2g)$ and $h_B = (v_B)^2/(2g)$.

If bodies A and B reach the heights $h_A$ and $h_B$ it is because some work has been done previously to move both bodies from the ground to their corresponding heights. Since the work (T) is defined as the product of the force (the weight) multiplied by the distance moved (d), which in this case is in the same direction in which the force is applied, it follows that $T_A = (p_A)(d_A)$ and $T_B = (p_B)(d_B)$. If these works are equal ($T_A = T_B$) the well-known law of the lever is obtained again: $p_Ad_A = p_Bd_B$.

Now consider that the weights of the two bodies are $p_A = m_Ag$ and $p_B = m_Bg$, that the distances traveled are $d_A = h_A$ and $d_B = h_B$, and that for each body the expression $h = (v^2)/(2g)$ is used. Therefore, the corresponding works are $T_A = p_Ad_A = [m_Ag][(v_A)^2/(2g)] = (½)(m_A)(v_A)^2$, and $T_B = p_Bd_B = [m_Bg][(v_B)^2/(2g)] = (½)(m_B)(v_B)^2$. Therefore, the equality of the total work done by the two falling bodies ($T_A = T_B$) corresponds to the conservation of kinetic energy: $(½)(m_A)(v_A)^2 = (½)(m_B)(v_B)^2$. 

Previous equation is known as the work-energy theorem, which can be derived from the definition of work as the integral of the scalar product of the force multiplied by the displacement $T= \int F∙dr = \int (m \frac{dv}{dt}) ∙dr =m \int (\frac{dr}{dt}) ∙dv = m \int vdv= (\frac{m}{2})(v^2)$.

CONCLUSION 2

The second natural state of bodies in motion is the uniformly accelerated motion of bodies falling from heaven to Earth. The case in consideration is the free fall of two bodies from different heights.

If the works done by those falling bodies are equal, the expression that corresponds to the principle of the lever is obtained. Equality in such works is equivalent to the conservation of kinetic energy for falling bodies.

**Variation of the first natural state of bodies in motion**: the uniform rotational movement of bodies on the Earth.

The lever shown in Figure 4.2 contains bodies A and B at its ends, with weights $p_A$ and $p_B$ at distances $d_A$ and $d_B$ from the center of balance C, which will be considered fixed. If we assume now that the weight of each body acts independently because they are not joined by a rigid bar, there will be two rotational movements. Depending on the direction of rotation a different sign is usually assigned: the rotation from left to right of the body A in the counterclockwise direction has a negative sign and the right-to-left rotation of body B in the clockwise direction has a positive sign.

However, if there is balance on the lever, there is no rotation with respect to C and the combined action of the torques produced by each of the weights is cancelled. Each torque is the product of the weight of the body by the distance from the point of application of the weight to the axis of rotation: $Torque_{left} = (–p_Ad_A)$ and $Torque_{right} = (+p_Bd_B)$. In the equilibrium condition with respect to the rotational movement, it must be that $Torque_{left} + Torque_{right} = 0$. From this condition it follows that $(– p_Ad_A) + (+p_Bd_B) = 0$ and $p_Ad_A = p_Bd_B$, which is the law of the lever.

For a body of mass m and velocity v the linear momentum is $p=mv=m(dr⁄dt)$ and the angular momentum is $l=r \times p$, If the force is F the torque is  $τ=r \times F$. It can be shown that $dl⁄(dt=( d[r \times p])⁄(dt=(dr⁄dt) )) \times p+r \times [dp⁄dt]=[r \times (dp⁄dt)]=r \times F=τ$. Then if $τ=0$, $dl⁄dt=0$ mens that $l$ is constant.

[The product $(dr⁄dt)  \times p$ is zero since the vectors $dr⁄dt$ and $p=mv$ are parallel.] Then, if the torque resulting from the action of two or more forces is zero the angular momentum is constant (conserved).

CONCLUSION 3

In a new consideration of the first natural state of moving bodies, the equilibrium condition of a lever which weights are applied at each of its ends would produce rotations in opposite directions. From this condition the law of the lever can be obtained again.

From the condition that the lever remains in equilibrium of rotation, it follows that the sum of the torques produced by such forces is zero, which corresponds to the law of conservation of angular momentum.
