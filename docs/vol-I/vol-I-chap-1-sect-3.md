## 1.3.  Contexts learning for conceptualizing cognitive spaces.

In this section we deal with the procedure named *Context learning for conceptualizing cognitive spaces*. The word context,(*contexto* in Spanish), comes from Latin *contextus*, derived from the verb *téxere*, to knitt (*tejer* in Spanish). Playing with the words *con-texto* is what comes with the text. In connection to writings, and not to textiles, it means the conducting threads that communicate sense and meaning in written texts. It refers to material, human, and social conditions framing the generation of products or services.

NOTE. Context learning can be related but do not correspond exactly to contextual learning or to Context-based learning.

Context learning is important in organizing knowledge for what is thought and learnt. It implies both the conceptual structure of the subject matter and the operational criteria for managing contents, procedures, and resources. Context learning is a practical procedure for describing cognitive spaces by exploring problematic situations, analyzing leading questions and performing learning and evaluation activities. Then, the following are the steps required in context learning:


1. Describe a **problematic situation** corresponding to a cognitive challenge to be understood and solved. 

2. Formulate **generating questions** to be answered to explain the context.

3. Propose **learning and evaluating activities** for answering these questions.

**Context of Archimedes´solution to the golden crown problem.**

### Context of Archimedes´solution to the golden crown problem.

- Next, we present an application of the context learning procedure to the buoyancy problem of the golden crown proposed to Archimedes by King Hiero of Syracuse24. A possible path of the solution, not necessarily the one implemented by Archimedes, will be considered both as a dictatorial or as a democratic conceptualization. In this case, the components of the corresponding learning context are the following:

- The following **leading questions** might had asked by Archimedes himself to answer the king´s suspicion: If the finished crown and the original block of gold weight the same but the crown is made of silver and not of gold, how much different the volume of a golden crown will be from the volume of a silver crown? How can I determine the volume of the probable falsified crown? 

- **Learning and evaluation** activities were those decisions and actions that were undertaken by Archimedes to solve the problem asked by King Heron.

The legend says that Archimedes shouted Eureka! when he understood the nowadays called principle of flotation: an object immersed in a liquid is pushed up by a buoyant force equal to the weight of the volume of the liquid displaced by the object. This means that any object submerged in a liquid experiment two forces: its downward weight and the upward push corresponding to the weight of the amount of water equivalent to the submerged volume of the object (the buoyant force). (Figure 1.3).

**Figure 1.3.** Two forces work in buoyancy: the upward force of buoyancy and the downward force of gravity.  

Archimedes experimental procedures could be considered as being democratic if he did focus on the universal definition of density as the quotient of mass divided by volume, because this definition applies to all bodies in the same manner. Furthermore, all submerged material must obey the floating principle.

The approach to the experiment could be dictatorial in the sense that he referred to the particular result of applying Archimedes’ principle where the buoyant force will depend on the submerged volume of the crown under the assumption that this condition must be different for different materials if they did not have the same density.

### What can we assume Archimedes was able to do?

It is possible that Archimedes was involved in the following activities: he weighted the finished crown and took a block of gold of the same weight; therefore, they had the same mass. He knew that the density of a golden crown will be higher than the density of a silver crown. Then, a crown made of gold will occupy a lesser volume than a crown made of silver.

By applying his buoyancy principle, Archimedes knew that the crown to be tested and the block of gold could experience different buoyancy forces if they had different volumes. The weight of the water displaced by the object with the larger volume will be higher than the weight of water displaced by a smaller volume.

The solution obtained by Archimedes can be summarized in terms of two processes: the analysis of the problem and the solution of the problem.
