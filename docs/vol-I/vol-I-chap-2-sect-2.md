## **2.2. Physics Nobel Lectures by Thomson, Millikan, Franck, Hertz, and Compton.**

In what follows, we consider two kinds of documents that are available in the web page of the Nobel Foundation: a document called WORK that explains in a very synthetic form the reasons for awarding the Physics Nobel Prize to Thomson, Millikan, Franck, Hertz and Condon, and their corresponding Nobel Lectures. All the documents include their references in MLA format.  When the Nobel Lecture contains subtitles, they are mentioned after the title of the Lecture. As the first document is fully quoted, quotation marks are used. The second document is described in a two columns table: the first column refers to *Accepted knowledge or questions under discussion in laureate´s time* and the second column concerns the *Laureate´s contributions or explanations*. 

### **1906 Physics Nobel Prize awarded to Thomson.**
	
WORK: "The idea that electricity is transmitted by a tiny particle related to the atom was first forwarded in the 1830s. In the 1890s, J.J. Thomson (1856-1940) managed to estimate its magnitude by performing experiments with charged particles in gases. In 1897 he showed that cathode rays (radiation emitted when a voltage is applied between two metal plates inside a glass tube filled with low-pressure gas) consist of particles— electrons—that conduct electricity. Thomson also concluded that electrons are part of atoms."

### **1923 Physics Nobel Prize awarded to Millikan.**
	
WORK: "During the 1890s the theory that electricity was conveyed by a miniscule unit, the electron, gained acceptance. In 1910 Robert Millikan (1868-1953) succeeded in precisely determining the magnitude of the electron’s charge. Small electrically charged drops of oil were suspended between two metal plates where they were subjected to the downward force of gravity and the upward attraction of an electrical field. By measuring how the various drops of oil moved about, Millikan showed that their charge always was a multiple of a precisely determined charge—the electron’s charge."

### **1925 Physics Nobel Prize awarded to Franck.**
	
WORK: "After the publication of Niels Bohr’s theory on the structure of the atom, James Franck (1882-1964) and Gustav Hertz conducted an experiment in 1913 to verify it. A potential difference was applied to a tube containing a low-pressure gas. When the potential difference was increased, the current flowing through the tube also increased until it reached a certain voltage, when it suddenly declined. The result supported Bohr’s theory, in which electrons can only have specific, discrete energies. The potential difference increased the free electrons’ mobility until, at a certain energy level, bound electrons jumped to a higher-energy orbit instead."

### **1925 Physics Nobel Prize awarded to Hertz.**

WORK: "After the publication of Niels Bohr’s theory on the structure of the atom, Gustav Hertz (1987-1975) and James Franck conducted an experiment in 1913 to verify it. A potential difference was applied to a tube containing a low-pressure gas.

### **1927 Physics Nobel Prize awarded to Compton.**

WORK: "According to Einstein’s photoelectric effect theory, light consists of quanta, “packages” with definite energies corresponding to certain frequencies. A light quantum is called a photon. When Arthur Compton (1892-1962) directed X-ray photons onto a metal surface in 1922, electrons were emancipated and the X-rays’ wavelength increased because some of the incident photon energy was transferred to the electrons. The experiment confirmed that electromagnetic radiation could also be described as photon particles following the laws of mechanics."
