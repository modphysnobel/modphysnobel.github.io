## **3. Detecting signals in the eye and creating maps in the brain.**

*What can be seen with our eyes and located in our brains?*

This Chapter refers to the process of viewing that occurs when the tracks of bundles of light rays are concentrated in the human eye. We also consider the processes of creating mental maps for positioning and orientation.

### **Learning objectives of Chapter 3.**

After this Chapter you should be able to: 

• Describe the Nobel Prizes in Medicine awarded in 1911, 1967 and 1981 concerning visual systems and processes.

• Describe the Nobel Lectures corresponding to the 2014 Nobel Prize in Medicine awarded for discovering a positioning system in the brain.

• Identify the cognitive procedures (Inquiring, Training, Comprehension, and Metacognition) in the description of the perihelion precession of the planet Mercury. 

###  **Description of content of Chapter 3.**

**Section 3.1. Understanding the mechanisms of vision.**
	
Section 3.1. Understanding the mechanisms of vision.

We comment on three Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine: to $Allvar$ $Gullstrand^1$ in 1911 “for his work on the dioptrics of the eye” [*Dioptrics is the study of the refraction of light, especially by lenses.*], to $Ragnar$ $Granit^2$, $Haldan$ $Keffer$ $Hartline^3$ and $George$ $Wald^4$ in 1967 “for their discoveries concerning the primary physiological and chemical visual processes in the eye”, and to $David$ $H.$ $Hubel^5$ and $Torsten$ $N.$ $Wiesel^6$ in 1981 “for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system”.

Section 3.2. Existence of a mental Global Positioning System (GPS).

We consider the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to $John$ $O’Keefe^7$, $May$-$Britt$ $Moser^8$ and $Edvard$ $I.$ $Moser^9$ “for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain”. Their investigations have served to understand the working conditions of a sort of mental GPS (Global Positioning System) used for visualization, memorization, and learning.

Section 3.3. Cognitive procedures for creating scientific knowledge.

We consider the process Cognitive procedures for creating scientific knowledge (Inquiring, Training, Comprehension, and Metacognition) and apply it to the description of the motion of the planet Mercury around the Sun.

## **3.1. Understanding the mechanisms of vision.** 

Intelligence comes from Latin *intus legere*: to read inside. We need eyes to read, to see and understand shapes and meanings. Human eyes function like windows to observe the external world, communication channels for transmitting messages and interpretation screens to receive and process electromagnetic signals in a range of frequencies limited by ultraviolet and infrared radiations. We see because external stimuli are transformed into internal images. The sense of vision implies control of light in motion.

Eyes are the first element in the chain eye-optic nerve-brain: the receiver, the transmitter, and the interpreter. This chain makes possible to distinguish, understand and employ representations of information and interpretations of knowledge about optical properties of objects. From the point of view of embryology eyes and brains come from the same type of cells.
	
The study of $Optics^{10}$, as a branch of Physics, deals with three aspects of light: geometrical optics concerns propagation in straight lines, reflection, and refraction (see Figure 3.1); physical optics refers to interference, diffraction and polarization, and quantum optics considers the behavior of photons and their interactions with different materials.

In what follows we analyze three Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine recognizing important contributions to the study of vision: the Prizes awarded in 1911 to Allvar Gullstrand, in 1967 to Ragnar Granit, Haldan Keffer Hartline and George Wald, and in 1981 to David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel. For each one of these six laureates we analyze two kinds of publications available in the web page of the Nobel Foundation: a full quotation of the document called WORK that explains the main contributions of each laureate and the description of their Nobel Lectures that we concentrate in a two columns table: the first one dedicated to *Accepted knowledge or questions under discussion in laureate´s time* and the second one regarding *Laureate´s contributions or explanations.*
	

### **1911 Medicine Nobel Prize awarded to Gullstrand.**

WORK: "Our vision is based on the eye’s lens breaking up light from the outside world and converting it into an image at the back of the eye. From here, $photosensitive$ $retinal$ $cells^{11}$ convert the light into nerve impulses that eventually become visual images. Calculating the path rays of light take through the eye and how an image is created is very complicated because the eye’s lens consists of different layers that refract light to different degrees. Moreover, the lens also changes shape. However, Allvar Gullstrand (1862-1930) succeeded in doing just that in the 1890s using advanced mathematics."

### **1967 Medicine Nobel Prize awarded to Granit.**
	
WORK: "Our vision works by the light around us being captured by a large number of light-sensitive cells located in the retinas at the back of our eyes. After a series of nerve switches and conversions of chemical and electrical signals, this results in visual impressions. Using very sophisticated electrodes, Ragnar Granit (1900-1991) was able to study the electrical impulses from the retina’s cells. In studies conducted from the 1930s to the 1950s, he demonstrated that there are different types of cones (the cells that enable color vision) and that these are sensitive to light of three different wavelengths."

### **1967 Medicine Nobel Prize awarded to Hartline.**

WORK: "Our vision functions because light from the surrounding world is captured by many light-sensitive cells in the retina at the back of the eye. A series of reconnections and transformations of chemical and electrical signals finally result in visual impressions. In studies of the horseshoe crab around 1950, Keffer Hartline (1903-1983) analyzed how the primary signals from visual cells are processed in a network of nerve cells. Among other things, he showed that when a cell is stimulated, signals from surrounding cells are suppressed. This makes it easier to understand the concept of contrasts."

### **1967 Medicine Nobel Prize awarded to Wald.**

WORK: "Our vision functions because light from the surrounding world is captured by many light-sensitive cells in the retina at the back of the eye. George Wald (1906-1997) found that vitamin A is an important component in rhodopsin, a light-sensitive substance in the retina, and explained in a series of studies from the 1930s to the 1960s how light causes rhodopsin to change form and be converted. This conversion gives rise to signals in a complicated network of nerve cells by which a number of reconnections and transformations occur before the signals eventually are transformed into visual impressions in the brain."

### **1981 Medicine Nobel Prize awarded to Hubel.**

WORK: "Our vision works by the light around us being captured by a large number of light-sensitive cells located in the retinas at the back of our eyes. The light is converted into signals that are sent to the brain and there converted into visual impressions. David Hubel (1926-2013) and Torsten Wiesel clarified how this process works during the 1960s: In the cerebral cortex signals are analyzed in sequence by cells with the specific tasks of interpreting contrasts, patterns, and movements. They also showed that this ability develops in children during the initial period after birth."

	**Hubel & Wiesel Come to Harvard.**

	"Hubel and Wiesel recorded electrical activity from individual neurons in the brains of cats. They used a slide projector to show specific patterns to the cats and noted that specific patterns stimulated activity in specific parts of the brain. Such single-neuron recordings were an innovation at the time, enabled by Hubel’s earlier invention of a special recording electrode. They systematically created a map of the visual cortex with these experiments. The original film projector, light filters and slides, are held at the Warren Anatomical Museum at the Countway Library of Medicine."

	**Plasticity & Critical Periods.**

	"Hubel and Wiesel demonstrated that some neurons were only responsive to information that came from a single eye, a phenomenon they referred to as “ocular dominance”. Intriguingly, neurons that are tuned to a particular eye cluster together in anatomical columns in the visual cortex of the brain. They called these “ocular dominance columns”. They also measured how distinct neurons respond to distinct visual features, such as the orientation of a line projected on a screen, or specific patterns of lines. These experiments were instrumental to our understanding of visual processing."

	"This precise organization called to question the role that experience plays in the development of the visual system. In a series of papers, Hubel and Wiesel showed that blocking visual input from one eye during the first few months of life dramatically altered the organization of the columns. When an eye of an adult cat was deprived of input, the organization of the ocular dominance columns did not change. Hubel and Wiesel concluded that such plasticity is limited to early life, and called this a ‘critical period’ of visual cortex development. The discovery of critical periods demonstrated how experience shapes the developing brain’s circuitry, thus perception of the external world. This finding applies across all sensory systems, and even has been shown to be present in the development of social behavior and language acquisition. This critical period of visual plasticity forms the basis for medical interventions in strabismus and amblyopia in children."


### **1981 Medicine Nobel Prize awarded to Wiesel.**

WORK: "Our vision works by the light around us being captured by a large number of light-sensitive cells located in the retinas at the back of our eyes. The light is converted into signals that are sent to the brain and there converted into visual impressions. Torsten Wiesel (1924) and David Hubel clarified how this process works during the 1960s: In the cerebral cortex signals are analyzed in sequence by cells with the specific tasks of interpreting contrasts, patterns, and movements. They also showed that this ability develops in children during the initial period after birth."
