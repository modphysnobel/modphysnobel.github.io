## **3.2.  Generation of a mental Global Positioning System (GPS).**

Maps are useful for understanding the meaning of position and direction: where are we and in what directions shall we move. A map is a schematic graphical bidimensional representation of a three-dimensional space including designs and drawings of places, paths, structures, and borders where objects are located and oriented trajectories can be tracked. Maps are useful tools for navigation in different kinds of environments. We need to read and interpret maps as complete and clear reference systems for being informed about positions, distances, orientations and motions.

A concept of a cognitive map as a conceptual representation of place in the brain was proposed in 1948 by $Edward$ $Tolman^{12}$ (1886 - 1959) who studied how animals learn to navigate by exploring their environment. More recently, John O´Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard I. Moser received the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, because their experiments demonstrated that inside the brain a sort of inner Global Positioning System (GPS) functions as a neurological network of nervous cells for the operation of higher cognitive functions.

In order to have an idea of the evolution of previous concepts, it is quite informative to consider the learning and research personal trajectories of the 2014 Nobel laureates. See their documents called Biographical:

In what follows, we quote the document WORK describing the main contributions of each one of the laureates and describe the content of his or her Nobel Lecture by indicating their corresponding subtitles. We present in three Appendices more detailed descriptions of their Nobel Lectures: Appendix 2A contains two parts: the first one related to the *Accepted knowledge or questions under discussion in O´Keefe´s time*, and the second one concerning *O´Keefe main contributions or explanations* reported in his Lecture. Next two Appendices contain excerpts of the other two Nobel Lectures: Appendix 2B corresponds to May-Britt Moser and Appendix 2C to Edvard I. Moser.

WORK: "The awareness of one’s location and how to find the way to other places is crucial for both humans and animals. To understand the ability to orient ourselves in space, John O’Keefe (1939) studied the movements of rats and signals from nerve cells in the hippocampus, an area located in the center of the brain. In 1971 he discovered that when a rat was at a certain location in a room, certain cells were activated, and that when the rat moved to another location, other cells became activated. That is to say, the cells form a kind of internal map of the room."

May-Britt Moser and Edvard I. Moser identified around 2005 another nerve cells: the grid cells which were arranged in hexagonal structures in the entorhinal cortex of the brain by forming a kind of coordinate system for navigation and path integration. These grid cells were embedded in a network containing other cells in charge of head direction and border functions. Their experiments demonstrated the existence of a computational center for spatial representation useful for recognizing and remembering precise positions and pathfinding. They have shown the existence of a sort of mental GPS.

Nobel Lectures described in the appendices indicate that memory and learning depend on cognitive functions that are involved in the collective activity of a system of interconnected neuronal cells. The existence of a GPS generator of cognitive maps that integrate four neural cells allow us to associate the functions of these cells to four cognitive procedures for creating scientific knowledge by building and using cognitive mental maps for learning purposes.


### **2014 Medicine Nobel Prize awarded to May-Britt Moser.**

WORK: "The awareness of one’s location and how to find the way to other places is crucial for both humans and animals. In 2005 May-Britt Moser (1963) and Edvard I. Moser discovered a type of cell that is important for determining position close to the hippocampus, an area located in the center of the brain. They found that when a rat passed certain points arranged in a hexagonal grid in space, nerve cells that form a kind of coordinate system for navigation were activated. They then went on to demonstrate how these different cell types cooperate."
