# II.  ENERGY

This is the second book of the series EXPLORING MODERN PHYSICS VIA NOBEL PRIZES. It deals with one of the most universal concepts in Physics as well as in many other sciences: energy. To change the state of motion of physical objects, some work needs to be done, coming out from inside the system or coming in from its external environment. Works are generated when any of those interacting agents called forces change positions, orientations or oscillations. From the physics point of view, work is both a requisite to change the state of motion as well as its consequence. Energy is required to produce work.

It is estimated that the universe contains 72% of dark matter (responsible for gravitational effects in galaxies and clusters of galaxies), 23% of dark energy (attributed to the accelerated expansion of the universe) and 4.6% of what up to now has been considered as common matter. It is from this smallest region of energy-matter that elements are made up of protons, neutrons, electrons, and anything that exists in the universe: stars, interstellar clouds, planets, living beings, â€¦. Inside this last component of energy-matter hydrogen represents 75%, then it means that the universe is filled with hydrogen up to 3.45%. The content of this Volume is the following:
