Archimedes name means in Greek \u201csuperior mind\u201d. He was born in Syracuse in 287 B.C and died in 212 B.C. when a roman soldier killed him during the assault to the city. His father was the astronomer Pheidias. Archimedes studied in Alexandria under the successors of Euclid.</p> <p>According to Durant (1966), the ten Archimedes\u00b4 books that survived had the following purposes:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Method: to explain how mechanical experiments can extend geometrical knowledge. </p> </li> <li> <p>A Collection of Lemas: to discuss alternative hypothesis in plane geometry. </p> </li> <li> <p>The Measurement of a Circle: to calculate de value of \u03c0 by using the method of exhaustion: he obtained the following bound values: 3 + 10/71 &lt; \u03c0 &lt; 3 + 10/70. </p> </li> <li> <p>The Quadrature of the Parabola studies: to calculate the area cut off from a parabola by a chord and the area of an ellipse. </p> </li> <li> <p>On Spirals: to define the procedure to draw a spiral and find the area enclosed by such a figure by methods approximating differential calculus. </p> </li> <li> <p>The Sphere and the Cylinder: to calculate the volume and the surface of these figures as well as those of a Pyramid and a cone. </p> </li> <li> <p>On Conoids and Spheroids: to study the solids generated by the revolution of conic sections about their axes. </p> </li> <li> <p>The Sand-Reckoner: to represent very large numbers like the number of sand grains in the universe. </p> </li> <li> <p>On Plane Equilibrium: to apply geometry to mechanics and to calculate the center of gravity of various bodies. </p> </li> <li> <p>On Floating Bodies: to find the position of equilibrium of a floating body. </p> </li> </ol> <p>To calculate Archimedes made a kind of mental experiments (thought_experiments) by thinking about geometrical figures as physical objects made of very small components in equilibrium. He wrote a treatise on Statics where he explained the working principles of the balance and the lever. According to Durant (1966), in Proposition VI of this treatise Archimedes wrote that \u201cCommensurable magnitudes will balance at distances inversely proportional to their gravities\u201d.</p> <p>Archimedes had great mechanical skills for designing and building machines while he tried to understand their functioning by making possible different energy transformations. Archimedes created a hydraulic screw to pump water, built a catapult for handling up to 80 kilos stones and prepared a pulley system to pull up ships with a hook and crush them against the walls of the city. He also organized an optical concave system with soldiers\u2019 metallic shields to concentrate sun rays and burn enemy ships.

We might teach by imposing rules of thinking and presenting solutions to problems according to prescribed procedures or we start by understanding what the students know and then build concepts and answer questions.</p> <p>As an example of diametral approaches for interpreting mathematical concepts and procedures let us consider two possibilities for explaining the meaning of the equation of a circumference: (1) in a dictatorial approach all the distances between the center and any point in the curve must be a constant, and (2) in a democratic approach all the points in a circumference are at equal distances to the center. Dictatorial approaches are repulsive, restrictive, centrifugal and go from the center to the periphery. Democratic approaches are attractive, liberating, centripetal and go from the periphery to the center.  </p> <p>A geometrical example.</p> <p>The equation of a circumference can be obtained by applying Pythagoras theorem: in cartesian coordinates we have \\(x^2 + y^2 = R^2\\). This equation could be described according to the previously mentioned approaches: in a dictatorial approach the distance from any point \\(P(x,y)\\) to the center in \\(O\\) must be equal to \\(R\\); in a democratic approach the coordinates of all points \\(P(x,y)\\) equally satisfy the same equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = R^2\\).

The entire population was always under conditions of domination and submission. There were no spaces for communications. Public affairs were not discussed, they were imposed. However, laws and rules were promulgated and made public in written. </p> <p>Vernant considered how the evolution of ancient Greek society generated two kinds of conceptual developments in social contexts related to the conceptuaization of space:</p> <p>(1) the building of circular spaces in family life and community (the reference is made to the philosopher Pherecydes, the historian and geographer Herodotus, the poet Homer, and the architect Hippodamus), and</p> <p>(2) the concept of circularity in the definition of astronomical spaces (reference is made to the poet and philosopher Hesiod and to the philosopher, geographer and physicist Anaximander).</p> <p>When Greek cities were built (the polis) writing was used as a transforming instrument that made public private issues. Probably it was Pherecydes of Syros (580 BC \u2013 520 BC) the first writer to publish a philosophical work in prose. He wrote books for transforming private knowledges into public possibilities for discussion. Herodotus of Halicarnassus (484 BC- 425 BC) mentioned that when the dictator Polycrates of Samos died, his successor asked all the citizens to meet in an assembly and informed them that he will behave in a democratic way in total disagreement with his predecessor</p>      (Image credit: CC Wikimedia Commons.)      <p>Homer (VIII century) wrote in Odyssey (chant II) that Telemachus, son of Ulysses and Penelope, was worried because many pretenders to the throne were harassing his mother. He asked soldiers to protect her by forming an agora (Greek word for an assembly). It is attributed to the same writer the use of the word ageirien laon, that means to congregate the army.</p> <p>One of the first urban architects Hippodamus of Miletus (498 BC- 408 BC) rebuild Miletus around 479 BC. The city was sacked and destroyed by Persians in 490 BC. The map made by Hippodamus shows an ordered reticular structure having an agora as its center with broader and straight streets.</p>      (Image credit: CC Wikimedia Commons.)      <p>According to Vernant, the new image of the democratic Greek society went in parallel with a new image of the astronomical and geometrical spaces. This conceptual change implied overcoming astronomical Babylonian ideas as well as eliminating myths about the form of the Earth.</p> <p>Astronomy in Babylon characterized a religion believing that stars were divinities whose intentions might be perceived if their positions in the sky were carefully observed and registered. Scribes serving the king were in charge for registering the economic activity of the kingdom and for accounting all celestial and terrestrial events. Their knowledge was arithmetic without connections to any geometrical system of spatial representations of positions and movements. However, Greek ancient astronomy was looking for explanations about the structure of the world without appeal to divinities nor ritual ceremonies, although it was full of myths.</p> <p>Hesiod of Askra; Thebes (nearby 800 BC) wrote a Theogony, a mythological treatise describing the origin of gods. According to him the Earth was a vessel whose interior contained a structured world enclosed by Zeus to avoid the perception of light in the disordered world: at the upper level lived Zeus and immortal gods, then the human beings and downward death and underground gods.</p> <p>Anaximander of Miletus, Ionia, (619 \u2013 546) had a spherical notion of the universe whose center contained the Earth as a cylindrical column at equilibrium, stagnant and without falling. This was a democratic conceptualization of space were all positions and distances were mathematically defined.</p>      (Image credit: CC Wikimedia Commons. The image of Anaximander corresponds to a detail of Raphael\u2019s painting in The school of Athens.)       <p>The agora.</p> <p>As a part of a demystification and rationalization process of the social life, the agora was a center for political actions and decisions with social, urban and cultural implications for the community. In that place democracy and law application were expressions of equality, equilibrium, symmetry and reciprocity. This was an indication of the appearance of new politically centralized institutions. </p> <p>Just for comparison, it is interesting to observe the presence of meeting regions in the following archeological sites: </p> <p> <p>Plan of Milet in the Classical period, nearby 490 BC.</p> <p> </p> <p>Sun pyramid in Teotihuacan, Mexico, nearby 450 AC.</p> <p> </p> <p>Residential palace in Machu Pichu, Peru, nearby 1500 AC.</p> <p> </p> <p>Massada in Israel, nearby 20 BC   </p> <p>For a broader treatment concerning conceptualization of spaces, see the following references: </p> <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_cognition</p>"},{"location":"vol-I/vol-I-chap-1-sect-2/#cognitive-spaces-in-quantum-statistics-fermions-or-bosons","title":"Cognitive spaces in quantum statistics: fermions or bosons.","text":"<p>In what follows, the conceptualization of spaces as dictatorial or democratic will be applied to the classification scheme of elementary particles concerning quantum statistics that separates fermions (contributions made by Pauli) from bosons (contributions made by Born).

He compares the activity of doing Physics to the observation of a game that takes place in nature. Furthermore, Feynman affirms that to know the rules of the game is to understand nature and that there are three kinds of procedures to know if the proposed rules work effectively:</p> <p>1)  To predict what will happen if the physical situation is relatively simple: the system has few components and can be verified if the rules in consideration are satisfied.</p> <p>2)  To analyze conditions when the proposed rules do not work and therefore to find the new rules that operate in regions up to now unknown or unexplored.</p> <p>3)  To make approximations to complex and diverse difficulties: to split, to classify and to simplify for understanding as much as possible with the minimum of requirements.</p> <p>Experimenting requires concrete questions to be asked to nature and solved by human interactions with apparatuses and devices. The physicists ask questions and make plans to prepare scenarios for obtaining answers: the experimental settings. Those are the conditions where the interactions with nature begin to produce, control, and detect what will be observed, measured, registered, and interpreted. Data will be obtained, and conceptual relationships will be tested, changed, or formulated under specific conditions. This might imply new descriptions, predictions, calculations or explanations of concepts, models, laws, or theories. </p> <p>To perform an experiment implies to arrange the experimental setting into three regions where physical interactions are generated: the input region of Preparation where the physical system is organized according to some initial conditions, the production region of Transformation where the specific interactions are produced, and the outcome region of Detection and Measurement where results of those interactions are observed, quantified, represented and interpreted. Sometimes the borderlines between these regions are not sharp nor well defined; however, they must represent in appropriate and sufficient manners the assumptions and intentions of the experimenter.</p> <p>In the input region the system is prepared under controlled situations that correspond to given values of a set of parameters and variables describing the structure of the system and their external requirements; these are the initial conditions of the experiment. Then it comes the crucial part of the experiment, the production region where interactions with external fields or other kind of agents modify the initial conditions producing effects to be observed and measured. The final region is for Detection and Measurement where some form of mathematical representation, mostly algebraic or geometric, will serve to express or validate physical interpretations. Observations and measurements must lead to understanding. It has been said that \u201call experiments are charged of theory\u201d: they are conceptualized according to what is known and unknown. </p> <p>At the beginning of past century four revolutionary experiments generated new ideas and opened the access to unexpected windows for understanding what an electron is.

When \\(C\\) is heated, a radiation is emitted, attracted by \\(A\\) and collimated trough \\(S\\). The initial conditions are the following: a particle of mass \\(m\\) and charge \\(q\\) leaves the cathode and arrives at the condenser with a horizontal velocity \\(v_{horizontal} = v_0\\) in a direction parallel to the plates \\(D\\) and \\(E\\).</p> <p>The region of Transformation (in green) corresponds to the inside of two charged metallic plates of a condenser (\\(D\\) and \\(E\\)) where the external electric and magnetic fields will be applied. If the electrostatic force \\(F_{\\mathrm{electric}} = qE\\) is applied, a transversal acceleration is generated in a direction perpendicular to the incident beam \\(a_{\\mathrm{transversal}} = a_t = qE/m\\).

Taking into account these two components of the displacement, the resulting equation of the trajectory inside the condenser is a parabola \\(y =  \\frac{1}{2} (a_t)t^2 =  \\frac{1}{2} (\\frac{qE}{m})[(\\frac{x}{v_0})^2] =  \\frac{1}{2} (\\frac{qE}{m{v_0}^2})(x^2)\\) which correspond to the form \\(y = Ax^2\\).</p> <p>The region for Detection and Measurement (in red) is active when the electron leaves the condenser and arrives at the screen.

They were experimenting first with drops of water and after with drops of oil.

The Preparation region is in blue, the Transformation region is in green, and the Measurement region is in red.</p> <p>In the region of Preparation an atomizer produces drops that go through a hole on a metallic plate that covers a cylindric chamber. In the region of Transformation a condenser inside the chamber has two metallic plates separated by a distance \\(d\\); the cylinder has four holes, three of them illuminate the interior of the plates and the four hole is for measuring the positions of the drop through a microscope. An external X ray source is applied for charging the oil droplets by ionizing them. Inside the chamber a potential \\(V\\) generated by an external battery produces a uniform electric field of intensity \\(E = V/d\\). Changes in the polarity of this battery made the charged drops to go down or to go up. In the region of Detection and measurement: an external microscope measures with a scale the positions of the drops when they travel in between the plates.</p> <p>Inside the chamber the drop experiments three forces (Figure 2.2): the weight due to its mass \\(m\\) (\\(F_{\\mathrm{gravity}} = mg\\)), the viscous drag force (\\(F_{\\mathrm{viscosity}}\\)) produced by friction with the air inside the chamber, and the electric force \\(F_{\\mathrm{electric field}} = qE\\) exerted by the external field E. </p> <p>According to Stokes law, the force of fluid friction is \\(F_{\\mathrm{viscosity}} = \u03ba\u03b7v_t\\), where \\(v_t\\) is the terminal velocity, \\(\u03b7\\) is the viscosity of the air, \\(\u03ba = 6\u03c0r\\) is a drag coefficient and \\(r\\) is the radio of a spherical drop; then \\(v_t = (F_{\\mathrm{viscosity}})/\u03ba\u03b7\\). If the external field E is zero the force \\(F_{\\mathrm{electric field}} = 0\\). For a stationary drop the resultant force must add to zero and therefore \\(F_{\\mathrm{viscosity}} = F_{\\mathrm{gravity}} = mg\\).

This is the velocity for free fall when the electric field is switched off.</p> <p>However, when the external field is not zero the net force \\(F_{\\mathrm{viscosity}} = qE - mg\\) and therefore, the terminal velocity in the presence of the field is \\(v_p = (qE \u2013 mg)/(\u03ba\u03b7)\\). After addition of the previous two terminal velocities we obtain \\(q = [(v_a + v_p)\u03ba\u03b7]/E = [(v_a + v_p)(6\u03c0r\u03b7)]/E\\).

Franck and Hertz accomplished this effect by generating inelastic collisions between two types of electrons: the external electrons produced by the filament that have been accelerated by the potential V and the internal electrons belonging to the atoms of Mercury contained inside the triode. Franck and Hertz changed the accelerating voltage V and then measured in the galvanometer the intensity of the current I produced by those electrons that arrived at the anode A.</p> <p>What was observed in the experiment was the following: When the accelerating potential \\(V\\) started to increase the current I also increased. At a critical value \\(V_c = 4.9\\) volts the current went down sharply; however, when the voltage increased again the current increased also. In arriving at a new critical value \\(2V_c = 9.8\\) volts, the same strong diminution of the current was observed. These observations can be interpreted as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When \\(V &lt; V_c = 4.9\\) volts the accelerated electrons have low kinetic energy and their collisions with the atoms were elastic ones: as the mass of the electron is much smaller than the mass of the atom, the incident electrons rebound and do not give energy to the electrons in the atom.</p> </li> <li> <p>When \\(V = V_c\\) the Mercury atom receives the exact amount of energy to excite their electrons to higher energy levels. Under this condition the collision is inelastic because the incoming electron has lost the energy that gives up to the electrons inside the atom; therefore, the current I diminishes.</p> </li> <li> <p>If now \\(V &gt; V_c\\) the current I increases until \\(V = 2V_c\\) and the collisions become inelastic again. These fluctuations in the current repeat when the voltage V attains a multiple value of \\(V_c\\).</p> </li> </ul> <p>It is interesting to note that in the atom of Mercury the difference between the lowest energy level and the first excited energy level corresponds to a spectral line whose wavelength is \\(\\lambda = 2536\u00c5\\).

The potentials of this development\u2014from the laws of learning to its detailed synaptic implementation\u2014really caught May-Britt and me. \u2026 Based on experiments on rats running in various types of mazes, Tolman suggested from the 1930s to the 1950s that animals form internal maps of the external environment.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022   \u201cIn 1971, John O\u2019Keefe and John Dostrovsky discovered that hippocampal cells tend to fire specifically when animals are at certain locations of the environment\u2026. In this overview, I will first review the events that led up to the discovery of grid cells and the organization of a grid cell-based map of space in the medial entorhinal cortex. Then, in the second part, I will present recent work on the interactions between grid cells and the geometry of the external environment, the topography of the grid-cell map, and the mechanisms underlying the hexagonal symmetry of the grid cells.\u201d</p> <p>2) Moving into unknown territory\u2014the entorhinal cortex.</p> <p>\u2022   \u201cCells in this area of the entorhinal cortex had clearly defined firing fields. \u2026First of all each cell had many firing fields. Second the fields were not at random positions in the environment, but neighboring fields rather seemed to be separated by a constant distance. There was a peculiar regularity about this pattern, but we did not understand the underlying algorithm.\u201d</p> <p>3) Grid cells and their functional organization.</p> <p>\u2022   \u201cThe multiple firing fields of the cell formed a hexagonal grid that tiled the entire surface space available to the animal, much like the holes in a beehive or a Chinese checkerboard. Many entorhinal cells fired like this, and we named them grid cells.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022   \u201cThere are at least three parameters of variation among grid cells: grid phase, grid scale and grid orientation. \u2026. Following the discovery of the new cell type, we set out to determine how the grid map was organised according to parameters such as phase and scale\u2026. The recordings showed indeed that grid spacing increases in discrete steps.\u201d</p> <p>4) A universal map.</p> <p>\u2022   \u2026. \u201cwe found that simultaneously recorded grid cells maintained scale, phase and orientation relationships across environments and experiences. \u2026 Cross-correlation maps of cells from different environments had vertices that were spaced in a hexagonal grid pattern reminiscent of the grid pattern in individual cells.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022   \u201cTaken together, these observations point to a key difference between grid cells and place cells. Grid modules are universal and rigid\u2014as would be expected by a metric for space\u2014whereas place cells take on a variety of patterns, as would be expected if they also participate in memory for events associated with the locations stored in the place-cell maps. \u2026 Thus, grid cells, like the other spatial cell types, exist across many mammalian orders and probably originated early in mammalian evolution, or before.\u201d</p> <p>5) Grid cells and the geometry of the environment.</p> <p>\u2022   \u201cTaken together, these analyses clearly point to shearing as the mechanism for grid deformation and grid rotation. The findings imply that local boundaries exert distance-dependent effects on the grid pattern. Whether these forces are mediated through the existence of border cells, which intermingle with the grid cells remains to be determined\u2014but it is certainly a possibility.\u201d</p> <p>6)    Fine-scale topography of the grid-cell network.</p> <p>\u2022   \u201cIn the next state-of-the-art part of my lecture, I wish to return to the anatomical organisation of the grid network. I showed you that within the resolution constraints of the tetrode technique, there seems to be no topography of grid phase, i.e. grid cells with different grid phases seem to be scrambled, at least at a macroscopic scale.\u201d</p> <p>7)    How is the grid pattern generated?</p> <p>\u2022   \u201cIn the final part of my lecture, I would like to address one of the most important questions raised by the discovery of grid cells, which is how these hexagonal patterns are generated. There is a variety of computational models for the formation of grid patterns, but most researchers now believe that attractor mechanisms are somehow involved. In a continuous attractor network, localized firing can be generated by mutual excitation between cells with similar firing locations.\u201d</p> <p>8)    General principles of network function.</p> <p>\u2022   \u201cIn some sense the network of grid cells, border cells, head direction cells and place cells provide the components of the neural computations envisaged at the behavior level by Tolman (1948) and at the cell assembly level by Hebb (1949).\u201d </p> <p>Next: 4.1 On Euclidean geometry and non-Euclidean geometries.</p>"},{"location":"vol-I/vol-I-chap-3-sect-1/","title":"vol I chap 3 sect 1","text":"<p>Volume I: Motion</p> <p>Previous: 2.3.

Maps are schematic graphical bidimensional representations of three-dimensional environments that might include positions, places, distances, paths, structures, orientations, borders and tracks of motions. Maps are useful tools where objects are located and oriented trajectories are represented.</p> <p>Ancient sailors used the constellations in the night sky to figure out theirs positions and directions. Nowadays, instead of stars we use satellites. All we need for map navigation is a simple hand-held GPS receiver as a component or segment of a Global Positioning System.</p> <p>A GPS is a system for making measurements of distances and times by producing, detecting, measuring and interpreting electromagnetic signals.  A typical GPS system, like the one used for communications in cellular phones, consists of three major segments: the space segment, the control segment, and the user segment. </p> <p>The space segment is a set of satellites surrounding Earth where signals are generated to indicate positions as well as times measured in atomic clocks located in the satellites. The control segment is a ground station collection of radars on Earth serving for localization and orientation of the satellites as well as for the registration of their orbits. The user segment corresponds to the cellular phones of the users who capture the signals from the satellites looking for visualizations of places and trajectories.</p> <p>Distances can be measured directly by sending a short laser pulse and measuring how it takes to travel between two points: a transmitter source of the electromagnetic signal in a satellite and a receiver in a ground station on Earth. The full time between emission in a satellite, its reflection on one receiver and the reception on the original satellite is two times the distance between transmitter and receiver divided by the constant speed of light. </p> <p>Although the speed of light signals is independent of the positions and velocities of the satellites, the times required to travel the distances between transmitter and receiver must consider the motions of the satellites surrounding Earth and the ground stations on Earth because our planet turs around the Sun. The frequencies of the clocks aboard the satellites are corrected regularly from the reference time maintained on the ground stations. </p> <p>Each GPS satellite carries an accurate record of its own position and time. A minimum of four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities: three position coordinates with origin at the Earth's center (latitude, longitude, and altitude) and the measured delay of the received signal corresponding to the time spent by the signal for traveling between the satellite and the receiver. Data defining for each satellite their own four-dimensional positions in space-time are computed simultaneously and continuously broadcasted. These coordinates may be displayed, such as on a moving map display, or recorded or used by some other system, like a vehicle guidance system.</p> <p>Two relativistic corrections must be done to the oscillatory frequency of the atomic clocks located inside the satellites: </p> <p>Velocity time correction: the clock in the satellite moves at high velocities with respect to the observer on Earth, then according to the special theory of relativity the faster an object moves, the slower its time passes (as measured by the frame's clocks). </p> <p>Gravitational time correction: the satellites are located at higher altitudes with respect the Earth\u00b4 surface, then according to general relativity the presence of gravitating bodies like Earth curves spacetime and therefore there is a relativistic time delay in radar signal travel time near Earth.</p> <p>The combined effect of previous corrections of time dilation causes the clocks on the satellites to gain nearly 38.6 microseconds per day relative to the clocks on the ground. When these corrections are neglected, errors in the determination of GPS positions are produced: range errors are up to 13 meters and vertical errors are over 20 meters. </p>"},{"location":"vol-I/vol-I-chap-3-sect-2/#existence-of-a-mental-gps-in-animals-and-humans","title":"Existence of a mental GPS in animals and humans.","text":"<p>A concept of a cognitive map as a conceptual representation of place in the brain was proposed in 1948 by Edward Tolman (1886 - 1959) who studied how animals learn to navigate by exploring their environment.

Cognitive procedures for creating conceptual models.","text":"<p>Creating scientific knowledge implies the development of learning activities for asking and answering pertinent questions, as well as the gradual integration and evaluation of practical visions and procedures for better understanding. All together might allow us to obtain good explanations of different phenomena by building better and better models. The word modelx comes from Latin modulus, a measure. In particular, conceptual models are simplified representations of the main characteristics of objects, persons, products, systems or circumstances. </p> <p>X: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model</p> <p>In this section we present four cognitive procedures for creating scientific models with the following purposes: to introduce scientific concepts (inquiring procedures), to propose and test conceptual relationships (training procedures) and to describe and apply successful cognitive structures (comprehension procedures). Then, the critical revision of the previous three procedures will correspond to a metacognitive procedure (to think about was taught). The aim is to have a guide for cognitive navigation for building, understanding, communicating and applying conceptual models.</p> <p>To accomplish previous purposes, it is helpful to navigate cognitive maps representing models and containing concepts, conceptual relationships and structures. One possibility is to use a cognitive GPS for guiding us to find positions and orientations in a cognitive space of ideas, questions and solutions. The working steps of such cognitive GPS would satisfy similar conditions as those of a typical GPS, like those used in common cellular phones. These cognitive GPS might follow the four cognitive procedures for creating scientific models:  Inquiring, Training, Comprehension and Metacognition. </p> <p>As we have seen in the first part of previous section 3.2, the following technological conditions are required to function in a communication GPS used for localization and orientation: a system of satellites surrounding Earth generates signals indicating their positions as well as the time measured in their clocks (this might correspond to an inquiring procedure); the users\u00b4 cellular phones capture the signals from the satellites looking for visualizations of places and trajectories (this might correspond to a training procedure), and a system of radars on earth provides information for the localization and orientation of the satellites as well as for the registration of their orbits around earth (this might correspond to a comprehension procedure). A fourth metacognition procedure might imply in this case to take into account two relativistic corrections to the oscillatory frequency of the atomic clocks located inside the satellites: one is because the intensity of the gravitational field varies with altitude and the other is because the clock moves at high velocities with respect the observer on Earth.</p> <p>Now we propose to connect each one of the functions of the four neural cells (place, grid, direction and border) that integrates a mental GPS, to the three segments composing a communication GPS for localization and orientation (the space, the control, and the user) and the relativistic corrections made to the oscillatory frequency of the atomic clocks located inside the satellites. Then. we associate these four elements (three segments and a correction) to the cognitive procedures for creating conceptual models where a cognitive GPS functions in terms of procedures for Inquiring, Training, Comprehension, and Metacognition. </p> <p>Each one of these three GPS is a useful tool for map navigation in a different environment: the mental GPS corresponds to neural networks working in the brain, the communication GPS is for localization and orientation used by humans in technological contexts, and the cognitive GPS is for the development of conceptual models. Next Table summarizes all these connections; afterwards we will present an application of the four cognitive procedures for creating conceptual models to the description of those physical models proposed by Kepler, Newton and Einstein to explain the orbit of the planet Mercury. </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"vol-I/vol-I-chap-3-sect-3/#description-of-the-perihelion-precession-of-mercury","title":"Description of the perihelion precession of Mercury.","text":"<p>What follows is an example of application of the previously described Cognitive procedures for creating conceptual models.

The first two laws were published in 1609 in Astronomia Nova and the third law in 1619 in Harmonice Mundi. </p> <ul> <li> <p>First Kepler\u00b4s law (the law of the orbits):  The planets move around the Sun in orbits which are ellipses, with the Sun at one focus. </p> </li> <li> <p>Second Kepler\u00b4s law (the law of the areas): A line joining a planet to the Sun sweeps over equal areas in equal times.</p> </li> <li> <p>Third Kepler\u2019s law (the law of the harmonies): The squares of the periods of revolution of the planets around the Sun are proportional to the cubes of the (mean) radii of their respective orbits.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The formulation of these laws introduced new concepts regarding planetary movements: the motion trajectories were described in terms of elliptic orbits instead of the Ptolemaic notions of epicycles and deferents, and the speed of motion did not correspond to uniform circular orbits but was assumed to vary inversely as the planet distance to the Sun.</p> <p>Training procedure: to make clear Newton\u00b4s scientific reasonings for explaining what previously has been observed, registered and interpreted.</p> <p>Isaac Newton (1642-1727) published in 1687 three books called Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica; the first two dealt with general theorems concerning the motions of bodies and the third one contained applications to the solar system. Newton proposed that a gravitational attractive force \\(F_G = G [\\frac{(m_S m_P)}{r^2}]\\) interacted instantly and at distance when the two interacting bodies, the sun of mass \\(m_S\\) and a planet of mass \\(m_P\\), were separated by a distance \\(r\\); \\(G\\) was a constant. Also, he defined force as \u201cthe rate of change of momentum\u201d \\(F=\\frac{d_p}{d_t}\\), where the linear momentum was defined as \\(p = mv\\), \\(m\\) representing the mass and \\(v\\) the velocity. </p> <p>By replacing the expression of \\(F_G\\) in the general equation \\(F=\\frac{d_p}{d_t}\\), Kepler\u00b4s laws can be explained in terms of the following mathematical considerations:  </p> <ul> <li> <p>The first law is a consequence of the fact that the force \\(F_G\\) is central, it is oriented in the direction of the sun to the planets. </p> </li> <li> <p>The second law is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum \\(l = r \\times p\\). In the case of planar elliptic orbits this implies that the quantity mvr is constant. This means that the planet moves faster at short distances in the perihelion (the distance sun-planet is the shortest) and it moves slower at long distances in the aphelion (the distance sun-planet is the largest). </p> </li> <li> <p>The third law is a consequence of the assumption that gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (\\(F \\thicksim 1/r^2\\)). </p> </li> </ul> <p>Newton could explain what Kepler predicted but without describing how the gravitational force was produced. He was able to change the magic approach due to Kepler into a mysterious explanation that promoted understanding but left open questions about the origin of the force that produced the observed planetary movements.</p> <p>Comprehension procedure: to describe the theories of special and general relativity created by Albert Einstein where he explains the physical properties of the universe in terms of geometrical properties.</p> <p>Careful measurements have shown that the position of the perihelion of Mercury appeared to be delayed after completing one full year of revolution around the Sun. During a century the principal axe of the elliptic orbit of Mercury had a very small deviation of 43 seconds of arc (Figure 3.5). According to the theory of general relativity this physical effect was produced by the geometrical circumstance that a curvature of space was produced by the enormous concentration of matter existing in the Sun. This explanation indicates that the gravitational force has a geometrodynamic nature.</p> <p> </p>      (Image credit: CC Wikimedia Commons.)      <p>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Drehung_der_Apsidenlinie_light.svg/440px-Drehung_der_Apsidenlinie_light.svg.png</p> <p>Figure 3.6.

Concerning the real structure of physical spaces, according to the available results of observations, experiments and calculations, it is now clear that the mathematical structure of such spaces is not Euclidean. Nevertheless, up to now a quantum gravity theory is still under development.</p> <p>The explanations given by Kepler, Newton and Einstein are elements in a chain of concepts, models and theories that solve some problems but leave open other questions.

The linear momentum of the total system is \\(m_Av_A + m_Bv_B\\). If before the collision \\(v_B = 0\\) and after the collision \\(v_A = 0\\), the conservation of linear momentum implies that before the collision we have \\(m_Av_A+0 = m_Av_A\\), and after the collision \\(0 + m_Bv_B = m_Bv_B\\). Therefore \\(m_Av_A = m_Bv_B\\). (We omit the vector notation since the motion is uniform and in a straight line.)</p> <p>We make two substitutions in the relation expressing the conservation of linear momentum: \\(m_Av_A = m_Bv_B\\). In the first substitution each mass is indicated as the quotient of the weight divided by the acceleration of gravity (g): \\(m_A = P_A/g\\) y \\(m_B = P_B/g\\). For the second substitution we consider that the movement is rectilinear and uniform and that each velocity is the quotient of the distance traveled divided by the time used to cover it. If the times are equal \\(t_A = t_B = t\\), then \\(v_A = d_A/t\\) y \\(v_B = d_B/t\\). For body A: \\(m_Av_A = (P_A/g)(d_A/t) = (P_Ad_A)/(gt)\\) and for body B: \\(m_Bv_B = (P_Bd_B)/(gt)\\). Equating the total linear moments and simplifying the common factor (gt) the well-known lever principle \\(P_Ad_A = P_Bd_B\\) is obtained.</p> <p>Second natural state of bodies in motion: the uniformly accelerated motion of bodies falling from heaven to Earth.</p> <p>Equations \\(h_A = (v_A)^2/(2g)\\) and \\(h_B = (v_B)^2/(2g)\\) are based on the following: </p> <p>1) The movement of free fall is rectilinear.</p> <p>In this movement, the object that is released from a certain height (h) and is allowed to fall without pushing it, at first has zero initial velocity (\\(v_{initial} = 0\\)) and when it falls it follows a rectilinear trajectory that corresponds to the vertical, if there is no air friction. However, such movement does not correspond to a uniform velocity because this physical quantity changes with time due to the action of the acceleration of gravity that causes the speed of fall to increase with time. When the object reaches the ground in a fall time (\\(t_c\\)) it will have reached the velocity \\(v_{final} = gt_c\\).</p> <p>2) Free fall motion is not uniform but uniformly accelerated.</p> <p>If the initial point from which the displacements are measured corresponds to the place from where the object is dropped out, the distance traveled will be the height (h) from which it is released. If the movement were uniform with velocity \\(v_{constant}\\), the distance traveled (h) would depend linearly on time \\(h = (v_{constant})(t)\\). However, since there is an acceleration that modifies the initial velocity, the distance traveled is \\(h = (v_{average})(t)\\) where \\(v_{average} = (\u00bd)(v_{initial} + v_{final})\\) is the average velocity. Then, as \\(v_{initial} = 0\\), it results \\(v_{average} = (\u00bd)(v_{final})\\).</p> <p>As in the previous case \\(v_{final} = gt\\), therefore \\(h = (v_{average})(t) = \u00bd(v_{final})(t) = \u00bd(gt^2)\\). Solving for time in \\(v_{final} = gt\\) and substituting into the previous expression \\(h = (\u00bd)(gt^2)\\) it can be obtained \\(h = (\u00bd)(g)(v/g)^2 = (v^2)/(2g)\\). This allows us to write that in the case of free fall of bodies A and B we have \\(h_A = (v_A)^2/(2g)\\) and \\(h_B = (v_B)^2/(2g)\\).</p> <p>If bodies A and B reach the heights \\(h_A\\) and \\(h_B\\) it is because some work has been done previously to move both bodies from the ground to their corresponding heights. Since the work (\\(W\\)) is defined as the product of the force (the weight) multiplied by the distance moved (d), which in this case is in the same direction in which the force is applied, it follows that \\(W_A = (P_A)(d_A)\\) and \\(W_B = (P_B)(d_B)\\). If these works are equal (\\(W_A = W_B\\)) the well-known law of the lever is obtained again: \\(P_Ad_A = P_Bd_B\\).</p> <p>Now consider that the weights of the two bodies are \\(P_A = m_Ag\\) and \\(P_B = m_Bg\\), that the distances traveled are \\(d_A = h_A\\) and \\(d_B = h_B\\), and that for each body the expression \\(h = (v^2)/(2g)\\) is used.

Therefore, the equality of the total work done by the two falling bodies (\\(W_A = W_B\\)) corresponds to the conservation of kinetic energy: \\((\u00bd)(m_A)(v_A)^2 = (\u00bd)(m_B)(v_B)^2\\). </p> <p>Previous equation is known as the work-energy theorem, which can be derived from the definition of work as the integral of the scalar product of the force multiplied by the displacement \\(W= \\int \\vec{F}\u2219d\\vec{r} = \\int (m \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}) \u2219d\\vec{r} =m \\int (\\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt}) \u2219d\\vec{v} = m \\int \\vec{v}d\\vec{v}= (\\frac{m}{2})(v^2)\\).</p> <p>Variation of the first natural state of bodies in motion: the uniform rotational movement of bodies on the Earth.</p> <p>If there is balance on the lever, there is no rotation with respect to C and the combined action of the torques produced by each of the weights is cancelled. Each torque is the product of the weight of the body by the distance from the point of application of the weight to the axis of rotation: \\(Torque_{left} = (\u2013P_Ad_A)\\) and \\(Torque_{right} = (+P_Bd_B)\\). In the equilibrium condition with respect to the rotational movement, it must be that \\(Torque_{left} + Torque_{right} = 0\\).

The magnitude of each vector is \\([\\vec{\u03c4}] = [\\vec{r}][\\vec{P}](sin\u03b8)\\) where \\(\u03b8\\) is the angle between the vectors \\(\\vec{r}\\) and \\(\\vec{P}\\), where \\(\\vec{r}\\) is the vector that joins the center \\(C\\) with the point where each weight \\(\\vec{P}\\) is applied. As can be seen in Figure 4.2, the angle \\(\u03b8\\) is 90\u00b0 for each weight. To each torque \\(\\vec{\u03c4}\\) produced by the force \\(\\vec{P}\\) corresponds a sign depending on the direction of the rotation: the clockwise rotation of the mass \\(m_B\\) is positive and the leftward rotation of the mass \\(m_A\\) is negative. Therefore, the magnitude of each torque is \\([\\vec{\u03c4_B}]=(\u03c4_B) = (+)[d_B][P_B]\\) and \\([\\vec{\u03c4_A}]=(\u03c4_A) = (-)[d_A][P_A]\\). </p> <p>When the complete mechanical system is in equilibrium there is no translation and no rotation, and the resulting torque is null. Therefore, \\(\\vec{\u03c4_A}+\\vec{\u03c4_B} = 0\\) which corresponds to \\(\u2212d_AP_A +d_BP_B = 0\\), From this, the principle of the lever can be obtained: the product of the distance of each mass to the center of balance \\(C\\) multiplied by the magnitude of the corresponding weight is equal for both bodies:</p> <p>\\(d_AP_A = d_BP_B\\)</p> <p>As in any mathematical approach involving geometric figures, it will be assumed that lines and points have no mass and their dimensions are one and zero, respectively. Furthermore, the lever principle applies only in a plane and not on surfaces with non-zero curvature.</p> <p>The explanation that the lever principle serves to justify that the parallel postulate is satisfied is contained in an annex of the book Non-Euclidean Geometries: Historical-Critical Exposure of its Development, published by Roberto Bonola (1874-1911) in 1912. According to Bonola, this explanation, which is not a demonstration, was made by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) and was published in volume XI of his complete works. This work was commented in a publication by Pepe, L. and Borgato, M. T.: Una memoria inedita di Lagrange sulla teoria delle parallele. Boll. Storia Sci. Mat. 8(2),307\u2013335 (1988). The explanation made by Lagrange is considered in Appendix 4A.</p>"},{"location":"vol-I/vol-I-chap-4-sect-1/#conservation-laws-concerning-the-linear-momentum-the-kinetic-energy-and-the-angular-momentum","title":"Conservation laws concerning the linear momentum, the kinetic energy and the angular momentum.","text":"<p>Following Don Juan Bautista de Oyarzabal Orueta (1913-1977) we connect the principle of the lever with the three natural states of bodies in motion as described by Galileo: (1) the uniform movement of bodies on Earth, (2) the uniformly accelerated motion of bodies falling from heaven to Earth, and (3) the circular motion of the stars in the sky. We concentrate on the first two states.</p> <p>First natural state of bodies in motion: the uniform translational motion of bodies on Earth.</p> <p>Consider the collision between two bodies approaching in a straight line with constant velocities: body \\(A\\) with mass \\(m_A\\) and velocity \\(v_A\\) and body \\(B\\) with mass \\(m_B\\) and velocity \\(v_B\\). If the sum of the external forces on the system of the two colliding bodies is zero, then the total linear momentum before and after the collision is conserved. Under such conditions, the expression corresponding to the principle of the lever can be obtained.</p> <p>Second natural state of bodies in motion: the uniformly accelerated motion of bodies falling from heaven to Earth.</p> <p>This case deals with the free fall of two bodies that are at different heights from the ground: body \\(A\\) is at height \\(h_A\\), while body \\(B\\) is at height \\(h_B\\). According to Galileo, the height of the free fall of these bodies depends on the square of the velocity and on the acceleration of gravity (g): \\(h_A = (v_A)^2/(2g)\\) and \\(h_B = (v_B)^2/(2g)\\). </p> <p>If the works done by those falling bodies are equal, the expression that corresponds to the principle of the lever is obtained.

If we assume now that the weight of each body acts independently because they are not joined by a rigid bar, there will be two rotational movements.

From this condition the law of the lever can be obtained again. From the condition that the lever remains in equilibrium of rotation, it follows that the sum of the torques produced by such forces is zero, which corresponds to the law of conservation of angular momentum.</p> <p>Next: 4.2.

In classical mechanics the states of motion of the inertial frames are physically preferred.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Euclidian geometry is valid for the laws governing the position of rigid bodies, the inertial frame and the law of inertia.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"In classical mechanics a distinction is made (absolutely) between unaccelerated and accelerated motions. Velocities have only a relative existence (dependent on the selection of the inertial frame), while accelerations and rotations have an absolute existence (independent of the selection of the inertial frame). This means that \"velocity relativity\" exists, but not \"acceleration relativity\".\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>(3)   Formulation of the law of inertia in classical mechanics.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"In an inertial frame the time is fixed and the state of motion to the system of coordinates is such that force-free material points undergo no acceleration. There is a lack of experimental criterion for whether a material point is force free.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Time is absolute, it is independent of the choice of the particular inertial frame. Time can be measured without disagreement by identical clocks which run down periodically in any arbitrary state of motion.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"There are an infinite number of inertial frames which are in uniform translational motion relative to each other, and hence there is an infinite number of mutually equivalent, physically preferred states of motion.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>(4)   Stipulation of meaning concerning motion.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"Motion can only be conceived as the relative motion of bodies with respect to some system of coordinates.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"The coordinate system is invariably represented by a practically rigid measuring body, not as something purely imaginary.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"In Euclidean geometry, rigid bodies can be positioned in rest relative to one another. This concept is only approximately achieved in Nature: interatomic distances change.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"It is physically significant that Euclidean geometry is valid in classical mechanics as well as in the special theory of relativity, but it is not in the general theory of relativity.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>(5)   The concept of rigid body.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"It is logically unjustifiable to base all physical consideration on the rigid body and then finally reconstruct that body atomically by means of elementary physical laws which in turn have been determined by means of the rigid measuring body.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"It would be logically more correct to begin with the whole of the laws and to apply the \"stipulation of meaning\" to this whole first, i.e. to put the unambiguous relation to the world of experience last instead of already fulfilling it in an imperfect form for an artificially isolated part, namely the space-time metric.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>NOTE: The concept of metric refers to the distance between two points. In Euclidean geometry this is represented as \\(ds^2= (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)\\). In the four dimensions of relativity the space time metric corresponds to \\(ds^2= (c dt)^2 - (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)\\).</p> <p>(6)   Principles of the special theory of relativity.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"Relativity principle: all inertial frames are equivalent for the formulation of the laws of Nature.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Light principle: the velocity of light in a vacuum is invariant.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"The special theory of relativity is an adaptation of physical principles to Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"To harmonize the relativity principle and the light principle, the assumptions that space and time are absolute do not apply.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>(7)    Measurements in the special theory of relativity.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"The state of motion and the time of the inertial frame are defined, in accordance with the stipulation of meaning, by the requirement that the light principle should apply to it.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"The Lorentz transformations for space coordinates and time apply for the transition from one inertial frame to another. The laws of physics remain invariant with respect to these transformations; they stay the same for all observers moving within different inertial frames of reference.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Consequences: the time for each inertial frame is measured by identical clocks that are stationary relative to the frame, the object's length of a moving object is shorter than the length measured in the object's own rest frame, energy and inertial mass are of like nature.\"\u2026</p> </li> </ul> <p>(8)   Preferred reference systems.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"According to the theory of light only a single state of motion is preferred: the one that remains stationary with respect to the light ether. In classical mechanics and in the special theory of relativity only states of motion are preferred in inertial frames.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"A profound modification of the geometric-kinematical principles is required if the laws of Euclidian geometry governing the position of rigid bodies do not apply, the Cartesian system of coordinates loses its significance in terms of the stipulation of meaning and the time can no longer meaningfully be defined by the indication on identical clocks at rest.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"A more general principle needs to be applied if in the formulation of the laws of Nature any arbitrarily moved frame of reference is equivalent to any other, meaning that there are not preferred states of motion at all in respect of regions of finite extension.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>(9)   Equivalence principle in the general theory of relativity.</p> <p>\"General relativity principle: let K be an inertial frame without a gravitational field and K\u2019 a system of coordinates accelerated uniformly relative to K. The behavior of material points relative to K\u2019 is the same as if K\u2019 were an inertial frame in respect of which a homogeneous gravitational field exists.\"</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"This principle implies that the systems of equations expressing the general laws of Nature are equivalent for all such systems of coordinates.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"The principle of equivalence means that gravitational attractions are of geometrodynamic nature:  the force of gravity is due to space-time deformations produced by strong concentration of matter. Physical interactions are explained in terms of geometrical properties.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>(10)  The special theory as an approximation of the general theory.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"For each infinitesimal point-environment in an arbitrary gravitational field a local frame of coordinates can be given such that no gravitational field exists; it is a local inertial frame. The results of the special relativity theory are correct to a first approximation for such infinitesimally small regions.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"There are an infinite number of such local inertial frames at any space-time point; they are associated by Lorentz transformations. If x, y, z, t represent coordinates and time measured with reference to a local inertial frame; Lorentz transformations leave invariant the \"distance\" ds of two infinitely adjacent point events such that:\"</p> </li> </ul>  $ds^2=c^2t^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2$  <p>(11)  The gravitational field equations.</p> <ul> <li>\"In Riemannian geometry two infinitely adjacent points are at a \"distance\" ds, the square of which is such that\"</li> </ul>  $ds^2=\u03a3g_{\u03bc\u03bd}dx_\u03bcdx_\u03bd$, ($g_{\u03bc\u03bd}=g_{\u03bd\u03bc}$)  <ul> <li> <p>\"The gravitational potentials \\(g_{\u03bc\u03bd}\\) describe the gravitational field. They determine the space-time metric \\(ds\\) which is defined as an (absolute) parameter measurable by means of rigid scales and clocks.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"In mathematical terms the search for the field equations amounts to ascertaining the simplest generally covariant differential equations to which the gravitational potentials \\(g_{\u00b5v}\\) can be subjected. To complete the basis of the general theory of relativity, the field equations must incorporate the electromagnetic field as well as the structure of matter.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>(12)  Problems with the law of inertia.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"According to Newton theory the observable material bodies are responsible for the gravitational behaviour of a material point. However, the material cause for the inertial behaviour of the material point is not indicated but attributed to the absolute space or to the inertial ether.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Mach demanded a modification of the law of inertia in the sense that the inertia should be interpreted as an acceleration resistance of the bodies against one another and not against \"space\".\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"In the general relativity theory, the distinction between inertial and gravitational effects is eliminated when the gravitational potentials \\(g_{\u03bc\u03bd}\\) are completely determined by the matter.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>(13)  Affine correlations in Riemannian geometry.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"The characteristic assumption of Riemannian geometry is the attribution to two infinitely adjacent points of a \"distance\" \\(ds\\).\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"To every line element (or vector) at a point P is assigned a parallel and equal line element (or vector) through any given infinitesimally adjacent point P\u2019; this defines an affine correlation.

As soon as we step beyond the established boundaries of pure thermodynamic theory, we enter a trackless region confronting us with obstacles which even the most astute of us are almost at a loss to tackle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf, as is the custom, I speak mainly about my own researches, I must say that I was fortunate in finding that not everything had yet been gleaned in the field of general thermodynamic radiation theory. Using known physical laws it was possible to derive a general law of radiation theory which has, under the name of the displacement law, been acclaimed by fellow workers. In applying thermodynamics to the theory of radiation, we make use of the ideal processes which have been found so fruitful elsewhere. These are mental experiments whose realization is frequently impracticable and which nevertheless lead to reliable results. Such deliberations can only be undertaken if all the processes on which, governed by laws, the mental experiments are based, are known, so that the effect of any change can be stated accurately and completely. Further, to be allowed to idealize, we must neglect all non-essential secondary phenomena, while considering only everything indissolubly connected with the processes under examination. In the application of mechanical heat theory, this method has proved to be extremely fruitful. Helmholtz used it in the theory of concentration flows, Van \u2018t Hoff used it in applying thermodynamics to the theory of solutions. It is necessary, in these deliberations, to presuppose the existence of a so-called semi-permeable membrane which permits the solvent to pass, but not the substance dissolved. Although it is impossible to prepare membranes which strictly satisfy this requirement, we can assume them as possible in the ideal processes, because the laws of Nature set no limit to approximation to semipermeability. The conclusions drawn from these assumptions have in any case always been in agreement with experience. In radiation theory, analogous deliberations can be made if we assume perfectly reflecting bodies as possible in the ideal processes. Kirchhoff used them for proving his famous theorem of the constancy of the ratio of emission and absorption power. This theorem has become one of the most general of radiation theory and expresses the existence of a certain temperature equilibrium for radiation. According to it, there must exist, in a cavity surrounded by bodies of equal temperature, a radiation energy that is independent of the nature of the bodies. If in the walls surrounding this cavity a small aperture is made through which radiation issues, we obtain a radiation which is independent of the nature of the emitting body, and is wholly determined by the temperature. The same radiation would also be emitted by a body which does not reflect any rays and which is therefore designated as completely black, and this radiation is called the radiation of a black body or black-body radiation.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#analysis-of-critical-concepts","title":"Analysis of critical concepts.","text":"<p>\u201cThe Kirchhoff theorem is not limited to radiation caused by thermal processes. It seems to be valid for most, if not all luminous processes. That the temperature concept can be applied to all luminous processes is beyond doubt. Since we can produce all types of light by means of hot bodies, we can ascribe, to the radiation in thermal equilibrium with hot bodies, the temperature of these bodies, and thus every radiation, even that issuing from a phosphorescent body, has a certain temperature for every colour. This temperature has however no connection whatever with that of the body, nor is it possible as yet to state how e.g. a phosphorescent body comes into equilibrium with radiation. These conditions are bound to be very complicated, in particular in the case of bodies which convert the absorbed radiation and emit it after a long interval of time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain using ideal processes and assuming radiation pressure, which at that time had been deduced from the electromagnetic theory of light, Boltzmann derived from thermodynamics the law, previously empirically formulated by Stefan, that the radiation of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#proposition-of-significant-relationships","title":"Proposition of significant relationships.","text":"<p>\u201cThis did not exhaust the conclusions to be drawn from thermodynamics. There remained the determination of the changes undergone by the colours present in radiation with changes of temperature. Computation of this change is again based on an ideal process. For this, we must assume wholly reflecting bodies as possible that scatter all incident radiation and which can therefore be described as completely white. If we allow the radiation coming from a black body to enter a space of this kind, it will in the end propagate exactly as if the walls of the space were themselves radiant and had the same temperature as the black body. If we then seal off the black body from the white space, we obtain the unrealisable case of a radiation permanently reciprocated between mirroring walls. In our thoughts, we continue the experiment. We imagine the volume of our space to be reduced by movement of the walls, so that the entire radiation is concentrated in a smaller space. Since radiation exercises a certain pressure, the pressure of light, on the walls it strikes, it follows that some work must have been expended in size reduction, as if we had compressed a gas. Because of the low magnitude of the pressure of light, this work is very small, but it can be computed accurately, which is all that matters in the case under discussion. In accordance with the principle of the conservation of energy, this work cannot be lost, it is converted into radiation, which further increases the radiation concentration. This change of radiation density due to the movement of the white walls is not the only change to which the radiation is subjected. When a light ray is reflected by a moving mirror, it undergoes a change of the colour dictated by the oscillation frequency. This change in accordance with the so-called Doppler principle plays a substantial part in astrophysics. The spectrum line emitted by an approaching celestial body appears to be displaced in the direction of shorter wavelengths in the ratio, its velocity: the velocity of light. This is also the case when a ray is reflected by a moving mirror, except that the change is twice as great. We are therefore able to calculate completely the change undergone by the radiation as a result of the movement of the walls. The pressure of light which is essential to these deliberations was demonstrated at a much later date, Lebedev being the first to do so. Arrhenius used it to explain the formation of comet tails. Before that, it was only a conclusion drawn from Maxwell\u2019s electromagnetic theory. We now calculate both the change of radiation density due to movement, and the change of the various wavelengths. From this mental experiment, we can draw an important conclusion. We can conclude from the second law of mechanical heat theory that the spectral composition of the radiation which we have changed by compression in the space with mirror walls is exactly the same as it would be had we obtained the increased density of radiation by raising the temperature, because we would otherwise be able to produce, by means of colour filters, unequal radiation densities in the two spaces, and to generate work from heat without compensation. Since we can calculate the change of individual wavelengths due to compression, we can also derive the manner in which the spectral composition of black-body radiation varies with temperature. Without discussing this calculation in detail, let me give you the result: the radiation energy of a certain wavelength varies with changing temperature so that the product of temperature and wavelength remains constant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUsing this displacement law it is easy to calculate the distribution of the intensity of thermal radiation over the various wavelengths for any temperature, as soon as it is known for one temperature.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#solution-of-challenging-questions","title":"Solution of challenging questions.","text":"<p>\u201cThe shift of the maximum of intensity in particular is directly accessible to observation. Since the wavelength at which the maximum intensity lies also defines the principal area of the wavelength which is most intense at this temperature, we can, by changing the temperature, shift the principal area of radiation in the direction of short or long wavelengths of any desired magnitude. Of the other derivations of the displacement law, I shall only mention that by H.A. Lorentz. If, in the electromagnetic equations of Maxwell, we imagine all spatial dimensions as being displaced in time in the same ratio, these equations show that the electromagnetic energy must decrease in proportion to the fourth power of displacement. Since, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, energy increases with the fourth power of absolute temperature, the linear dimensions must vary inversely proportionately to the absolute temperature. Each characteristic length must vary in this ratio, from which the displacement law follows.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom the displacement law, we can calculate the temperature of the sun if we are entitled to assume that the radiation of the sun must be ascribed to heat, and if we know the position of the maximum of the energy of solar radiation. Different figures are given for this position by different observers, i.e. 0.532 m according to Very, and 0.433 m according to Abbot and Fowle. Depending on the figure used, the temperature of the sun works out at 5,530\u00b0 and 6,790\u00b0. However much the observers may differ, there can be no doubt that the maximum of solar radiation is situated in the visible range of wavelengths. This is to say that the temperature of the sun is the most favourable utilization of the radiant energy of a black body for our illumination and that, in our artificial light sources which utilize thermal radiation we must aim at achieving this temperature, from which we are admittedly far removed as yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish to discuss yet another application of the displacement law, i.e. the possibility of calculating the wavelength of X-rays. As we know, X-rays are produced by the impact of electrons on solid bodies, and their wavelength must be a function of the velocity of the electrons. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the mean kinetic energy of a molecule is a measure of absolute temperature. If, as is done in the theory of electrons, we assume that this is also valid for the kinetic energy of the electrons, the electric energy of the cathode rays would be a measure of their temperature. If we substitute the temperature thus calculated in the displacement law, we find that the wavelength of the maximum of the intensity indicates a wavelength range of X-rays which agrees well with the wavelengths found by other arguments. It might be objected that we must not ascribe a temperature to the electrons. The permissibility of our procedure can however be justified by an inversion of the above argument. Radiation in an enclosed space must necessarily release electrons whose velocity according to Einstein\u2019s law is proportional to the oscillation frequency. The energy maximum of radiation generates electrons whose velocity is so great that their kinetic energy comes very close to the temperature associated with the maximum of energy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe displacement law exhausts the conclusions that can be drawn from pure thermodynamics with respect to radiation theory. All these conclusions have been confirmed by experience. The individual colours present in the radiation are mutually wholly independent. The manner in which at a given temperature the intensity of radiation is distributed over the individual wavelengths cannot be determined from thermodynamics. For this, one must examine the mechanism of the radiation process in detail. Similar conditions obtain in the theory of gases. Thermodynamics can tell us nothing about the magnitude of the specific heat of the gases; what is required, is to examine molecular motion. But the kinetic theory of gases which is based on probability calculations has made much greater progress than the corresponding theory of radiation. The statistical theory of gases has set itself the task of accounting also for the laws of thermodynamics. I do not wish to discuss here the extent to which the task may be considered as having been solved, and whether we are entitled to consider the reduction of the second law to probability as a wholly satisfactory theory. It has in any case been very successful, in particular since a theoretical explanation has been found of the deviations from the thermodynamic state of equilibrium, the so-called fluctuations, e.g. in Brownian movement. None of the statistical theories of radiation has however as yet even attempted to derive the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the displacement law, which must always be introduced into theory from outside. Quite apart from this, we are as yet far removed from a satisfactory theory to account for the distribution of radiation energy over the individual wavelengths.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI myself made the first attempt in this direction. I endeavoured to bypass the problem of applying probability calculation to radiation theory by imagining radiation as resulting from gas molecules moving according to laws of probability. Instead of these we could also imagine electrons generating radiation on striking molecules. What is essential is the further assumption that such a particle will only emit radiation of a certain wavelength dictated by velocity, and that the velocity distribution of the particles obeys Maxwell\u2019s law. With the assistance of the radiation laws derived from thermodynamics we obtain a radiation law which shows good agreement with experience for a wide range of wavelengths, i.e. for the range in which the product of temperature and wavelength is not unduly large.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImperfect as this first attempt was, a formula had been obtained which considerably deviates from reality for large wavelengths only. Since observations however establish these deviations beyond doubt, it was clear that the formula had to be modified.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLord Rayleigh was the first to approach the problem from an entirely different angle. He made the attempt to apply to the radiation problem a very general theorem of statistical mechanics, i.e. the theorem of the uniform distribution of energy over the degrees of freedom of the system in the state of statistical equilibrium. The meaning of this theorem is as follows:\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the state of thermal equilibrium, all movements of the molecules are so completely irregular that there exists no movement which would be preferred over any other. The position of the moving parts can be established by geometrical parameters which are mutually independent and in the direction of which the movement falls. These are called the degrees of freedom of the system. As regards the kinetic energy of movement, no degree of freedom is preferred over another, so that each contains the same amount of the total energy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRadiation present in an empty space can be represented so that a given number of degrees of freedom is allocated to it. If the waves are reflected back and forth by the walls, systems of standing waves are established which adapt themselves to the distances between two walls. This is most easily understood if we consider a vibrating string which can execute an arbitrary number of individual vibrations, but whose half wavelengths must be equal to the length of the string divided by an integer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe individual standing waves possible represent the determinants of the processes and correspond to the degrees of freedom. If we allocate to each degree of freedom its proper amount of energy, we obtain the Rayleigh radiation law, according to which the emission of radiation of a given wavelength is directly proportional to the absolute temperature, and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. The law agrees with observation at exactly the point where the law discussed above failed, and it was at first considered to be a radiation law of limited validity. But if the process of radiation obeys the general laws of electromagnetic theory or of the theory of electrons, we must necessarily arrive at Rayleigh\u2019s radiation law, as Lorentz has shown. Viewed as a general radiation law, it directly contradicts all experience, because, according to it, energy would have to accumulate increasingly at the shortest wavelengths. The possibility that we are not dealing in reality with a true state of equilibrium of radiation, but that it very gradually approaches the state where all energy is only present in the shortest wavelengths, is also contradicted by experience. In the case of the visible rays, to which the Rayleigh formula no longer applies at attainable temperatures, we can easily calculate, according to the Kirchhoff law, that the state of equilibrium must be attained in the shortest time, which state however remains far removed from the Rayleigh law. We thus obtain an inkling of the extraordinary difficulties which confront exact definition of the radiation formula. The knowledge that current general electromagnetic theory is insufficient, that the theory of electrons is inadequate, to account for one of the most common of phenomena, i.e. the emission of light, remains purely negative as yet. We only know how the thing cannot be done, but we lack the signposts that would enable us to find our way. We do however know that none of the models whose mode of action is based on purely electromagnetic principles can lead to correct results.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#explanation-of-new-results","title":"Explanation of new results.","text":"<p>\u201cIt is the merit of Planck to have introduced new hypotheses which enable us to avoid Rayleigh\u2019s radiation law. For long waves, this law is undoubtedly correct, and the right radiation formula must have a form such that, for very long waves, it passes into Rayleigh\u2019s law, and for short waves into the law formulated by me. Planck therefore retains as starting point the distribution of energy over the degrees of freedom of the system, but he subjects this distribution of energy to a restriction by introducing the famous hypothesis of elements of energy, according to which energy is not infinitely divisible, but can only be distributed in rather large quantities which cannot be divided further. This hypothesis would probably have been accepted without difficulty, if unchangeable particles, e.g. atoms of energy had been involved. It is an assumption that has proved inevitable for matter and electricity. The energy elements of Planck are however no atoms of energy; on the contrary, the displacement law requires that they are inversely proportional to the wavelength of a given vibration. This represents great difficulty for the understanding of these energy elements. Once we accept the hypothesis, we arrive at an entirely different distribution of energy over the radiating centres, if we search for them according to the laws of probability. This does not however give us the radiation law. All we know is how much energy the radiating molecules possess on average at a certain temperature, but not how much energy they emit. To derive emission at a given energy, we need a definite model which emits radiation. We can only construct such a model on the foundation of the known electromagnetic laws, and it is at this early point that the difficulty of the theory starts. On the one hand we relinquish the electromagnetic laws by introducing the energy elements; on the other hand we make use of these same laws for discovering the relationship between emission and energy. It could admittedly be argued that the electromagnetic laws are only valid for mean values taken over extended periods, whereas the energy elements relate to the elementary radiation process itself. An oscillator radiating in accordance with the electromagnetic laws will indeed have little similarity with the real atoms. Planck however rightly argues that this does not matter precisely because radiation in the equilibrium state is independent of the nature of the emitting bodies. It will however be required of a model which is to stand for the real atoms that it should lack none of the essential characteristics of the event under consideration. Every body that emits thermal rays has the characteristic that it is able to convert thermal rays of one wavelength into thermal rays of a different wavelength. It is on this that there rests the possibility of a specific spectral composition being established in the radiation at all times. The Planck oscillator lacks this ability, and doubts are bound to be raised as to whether it can properly be used for establishing the relationship between energy and emission. This difficulty can be avoided, and the oscillator can be done without, if, with Debye, we decompose the radiation energy in a hollow cube into Planck energy elements and distribute these energy elements over the oscillation frequencies of the standing waves formed in the cube according to the laws of probability. The logarithm of this probability will then be proportional to entropy, and the law of radiation results, if we search for the maximum of this entropy. This result is proof of the extremely general nature of Planck\u2019s concepts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are however further difficulties. The energy elements increase with decreasing wavelength, and an oscillator exposed to incident radiation will, at low intensity, need a very long time before it absorbs a full energy element. What happens if the incident radiation ceases, before an entire energy element has been absorbed? The difficulties implicit in answering this question have recently induced Planck to reformulate his original theory. He now assumes of emission only that it can occur exclusively by whole energy elements. Absorption is assumed to occur continuously according to the electromagnetic laws, and the energy content of an oscillator is assumed to have energy values capable of continuous change. The difficulty of the long absorption time is indeed avoided in this manner. On the other hand the close relationship between emission and absorption for the elementary process is relinquished, and this relationship now becomes valid statistically only. Every atom which only emits whole energy elements and absorbs continuously would therefore in the event of emission suddenly expend energy from its own reserve and would supplement this but little in the event of short irradiation. The special hypothesis must be made that, taken as a whole for many atoms in the stationary state, the absorbed energy after all becomes equal to that emitted. Whereas in the original form of the Planck theory the introduction of the hypothesis of energy elements was sufficient to permit the radiation laws to be derived, the new theories include uncertainties which can only be removed by further hypotheses. On the other hand the new fundamental hypothesis provides the possibility of further application, e.g. to electron emission.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will be seen from the few observations I am able to offer in this context how great are the difficulties that remain in radiation theory. But the reference to these difficulties which it is the duty of the scientific approach to emphasize must not prevent us from paying tribute to the great positive achievements which the Planck theory has already accomplished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has produced a law of radiation which accommodates all observed data and includes the Rayleigh formula and my own formula as limiting cases. In addition, it has thrown unexpected light on an entirely different subject, i.e. the theory of specific heats.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#possibilities-for-further-understanding","title":"Possibilities for further understanding.","text":"<p>\u201cIt has long been known that the specific heats do not strictly obey the Dulong-Petit law and that they decrease at low temperatures. Diamonds do not obey the Dulong-Petit law even at normal temperatures. This law can be derived from the theorem of the distribution of kinetic energy over the degrees of freedom and states that, in solid bodies, every atom possesses, in accordance with its three degrees of freedom, three times the amount of energy, and, because of the potential energy, altogether six times the amount of energy of a degree of freedom. If however we apply Planck\u2019s distribution of energy by energy elements, we obtain, according to Einstein, a formula for the specific heat which does in fact show the drop of temperature. This result is characteristic of the Planck theory. This theory of specific heats is not derived from the radiation formula, but from the formula for the mean energy of an oscillator which is based directly on the hypothesis of the energy elements. Unfortunately, difficulties are beginning to appear. The exact measurements of specific heats at low temperatures made in Nernst\u2019s laboratory have shown that the Einstein formula does not agree with observation. The formula which satisfies the experimental data contains half energy elements in addition to the whole energy elements, which cannot be interpreted satisfactorily as yet. There can however be no doubt that the Planck radiation theory provides the first step to the theory of specific heats.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat the theory should remain in many respects incomplete and provisional, is in the nature of the problem which is perhaps the most difficult which has ever confronted theoretical physics. What is involved is to leave behind the laws of theoretical physics confirmed by direct observation, which alone have been applied in the past, and to enter areas which are beyond the reach of direct observation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe difficulties which beset radiation theory also emerge in an entirely different approach. Einstein investigated the fluctuations to which radiation is continuously subjected even in the state of equilibrium as a result of the irregularities of the thermal processes. If we imagine a small plate in a cavity filled with radiation, this plate will be subjected to a radiation pressure which is the same on average on both sides of the plate. Since the radiation must contain irregularities, the pressure will alternately be greater on one or the other side so that the plate will execute small irregular movements, similar to the Brownian movement of a dust particle suspended in a liquid. These fluctuations can be derived from probability calculations. According to the Boltzmann theorem there is a simple relationship between entropy and probability. The entropy of radiation is known from the radiation law, so that the probability of state is also known, from which the fluctuations can be calculated. The mathematical expression for these fluctuations consists, in a peculiar manner, of two members. The first is readily understandable: it is due to irregularities which arise as a result of the mutual interference of the many independent beams which meet in one point. Where the density of radiation energy is high, this term alone predominates; it corresponds to the radiation range that obeys Rayleigh\u2019s law.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe other term, which cannot be directly explained by the undulation theory, predominates at low density of radiation energy, where the radiation obeys the law formulated by me. It would be understandable if the radiation consisted of the Planck energy elements which would be localized even in an empty space. We cannot however pursue this line of thought. We cannot shake the undulation theory of light, which is one of the most firmly established constructions in the whole of physics. Moreover, the term to be explained by localized energy elements, is not present by itself, and it is a priori impossible to introduce a dualistic approach into optics, e.g. to assume simultaneously Huyghens\u2019 wave theory and Newton\u2019s emanation theory. All we can do is to relinquish the Boltzmann method of applying probability calculations to this type of fluctuations, or to assume that a new irregularity is introduced into radiation with the process of reflection.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn view of the magnitude of the difficulties it is natural that opinions about the path to be pursued should differ greatly. Some are of the opinion that the fundamental principles of electrodynamics must be changed. And yet, previous theory embraces a vast range of facts, it accounts for events even in the most rapid movements of the b-rays, it has proved itself in the most precise optical measurements. In my view, all the signs suggest that the deviations from current theory are due to events within the atom. None of the processes in which the interior of the atom participates are amenable to current theory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSommerfeld made an attempt in this direction: He would ascribe to the constant h of the radiation law, which together with the oscillation frequency dictates the magnitude of the energy element, a simple significance for the interior of the atom. It is alleged to determine the period in which an electron entering the atom comes to a stop, as a function of its velocity. On this view, the constant h expresses a universal characteristic of the atoms. This theory permits calculation of the wavelength of X-rays, and it connects two previously independent attempts made by me to carry out this calculation. One method is based on the Planck theory of energy elements in that it assumes that the energy of the so-called secondary electrons released by Xrays is dictated by the energy element. The second method is based on the theory of electrons by means of which it calculates the energy radiated in the X-rays by sudden braking of an electron. From the determination of the energy of the cathode rays and the X-rays we can then calculate the brake path of the electrons and consequently the wavelength of the X-rays. The Sommerfeld theory connects these two theories. It has the great advantage of explaining the generation of X-rays with the aid of electromagnetic theory. A number of conclusions can then be drawn from this which are in complete agreement with observation, e.g. the polarisation of X-rays, the diversity of emission and of hardness in various directions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Sommerfeld theory has the great advantage that it attempts to invest the universal constant h of the Planck radiation theory with physical significance. It has the disadvantage that it has been applied so far only to electron emission and absorption, but cannot yet solve the problem of thermal radiation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe must admit that the result of radiation theory todate is not a very good one for theoretical physics. As we have seen, only the general thermodynami theories have proved satisfactory as yet. The theory of electrons has come to grief over the radiation problem, the Planck theory has not yet been brought into a definite form. Research is faced with exceptional difficulties and we cannot discern when and how they can be overcome. In science, the redeeming idea often comes from an entirely different direction, investigations in an entirely different field often throw unexpected light on the dark aspects of unresolved problems. We must base our hope in the future in the expectation that the present era which has proved so fruitful for physics may not pass without a complete solution being found for the problem of thermal radiation. Far-reaching and new thoughts will have to set to work, but the result will be great, because we shall obtain a profound insight into the world of the atom and the elementary processes within it.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#appendix-5b-transcription-of-planck-s-nobel-lecture","title":"Appendix 5B.

And the whole strenuous intellectual work of an industrious research worker would appear, after all, in vain and hopeless, if he were not occasionally through some striking facts to find that he had, at the end of all his criss-cross journeys, at last accomplished at least one step which was conclusively nearer the truth. An indispensable hypothesis, even though still far from being a guarantee of success, is however the pursuit of a specific aim, whose lighted beacon, even by initial failures, is not betrayed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor many years, such an aim for me was to find the solution to the problem of the distribution of energy in the normal spectrum of radiating heat. Since Gustav Kirchhoff has shown that the state of the heat radiation which takes place in a cavity bounded by any emitting and absorbing substances of uniform temperature is entirely independent upon the nature of the substances, a universal function was demonstrated which was dependent only upon temperature and wavelength, but in no way upon the properties of any substance. And the discovery of this remarkable function promised deeper insight into the connection between energy and temperature which is, in fact, the major problem in thermodynamics and thus in the whole of molecular physics. To attain this there was no other way but to seek out from all the different substances existing in Nature one of known emissive and absorptive power, and to calculate the properties of the heat radiation in stationary energy exchange with it. According to Kirchhoff\u2019s Law, this would have to prove independent of the nature of the body.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#analysis-of-critical-concepts_1","title":"Analysis of critical concepts.","text":"<p>\u201cHeinrich Hertz\u2019s linear oscillator, whose laws of emission, for a given frequency, Hertz had just previously completely developed, seemed to me to be a particularly suitable device for this purpose. If a number of such Hertzian oscillators are set up within a cavity surrounded by a sphere of reflecting walls, then by analogy with audio oscillators and resonators, energy will be exchanged between them by the output and absorption of electromagnetic waves, and finally stationary radiation corresponding to Kirchhoff\u2019s Law, the so-called black-body radiation, should be set up within the cavity. I was filled at that time with what would be thought today naively charming and agreeable expectations, that the laws of classical electrodynamics would, if approached in a sufficiently general manner with the avoidance of special hypotheses, be sufficient to enable us to grasp the most significant part of the process to be expected, and thus to achieve the desired aim. I, therefore, developed first the laws of emission and absorption of a linear resonator on the most general basis, in fact I proceeded on such a detour which could well have been avoided had I made use of the existing electron theory of H.A. Lorentz, already basically complete. But since I did not quite trust the electron hypothesis, I preferred to observe that energy which flowed in and out through an enclosing spherical surface around the resonator at a suitable distance from it. By this method, only processes in a pure vacuum came into account, but a knowledge of these was sufficient to draw the necessary conclusions however, about the energy changes in the resonator.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#proposition-of-significant-relationships_1","title":"Proposition of significant relationships.","text":"<p>\u201cThe fruit of this long series of investigations, of which some, by comparison with existing observations, mainly the vapour measurements by V. Bjerknes, were susceptible to checking, and were thereby confirmed, was the establishment of the general connection between the energy of a resonator of specific natural period of vibration and the energy radiation of the corresponding spectral region in the surrounding field under conditions of stationary energy exchange. The noteworthy result was found that this connection was in no way dependent upon the nature of the resonator, particularly its attenuation constants \u2013 a circumstance which I welcomed happily since the whole problem thus became simpler, for instead of the energy of radiation, the energy of the resonator could be taken and, thereby, a complex system, composed of many degrees of freedom, could be replaced by a simple system of one degree of freedom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, the result meant no more than a preparatory step towards the initial onslaught on the particular problem which now towered with all its fearsome height even steeper before me. The first attempt upon it went wrong, for my original secret hope that the radiation emitted from the resonator can be in some characteristic way or other distinguished from the absorbed radiation and thereby allow a differential equation to be set up, from the integration of which one could gain some special condition for the properties of stationary radiation, proved false. The resonator reacted only to those rays which it also emitted, and was not in the slightest bit sensitive to the adjacent spectral regions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFurthermore, my hypothesis that the resonator could exercise a unilateral, i.e. irreversible, effect upon the energy in the surrounding radiation field, was strongly contested by Ludwig Boltzmann, who, with his riper experience in these problems, proved that according to the laws of classical dynamics each of the processes observed by me can proceed in exactly the opposite direction, in such a way, that a spherical wave emitted from the resonator, returns and contracts in steadily diminishing concentric spherical surfaces inwards to the resonator, and is again absorbed by it, thereby allowing the formerly absorbed energy to be re-transmitted into space in the direction from which it came. And when I excluded this kind of singular process, such as an inwardly directed wave, by means of the introduction of a limiting definition, the hypothesis of natural radiation, all these analyses still showed ever more clearly that an important connecting element or term, essential for the complete grasp of the core of the problem, must be missing.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#solution-of-challenging-questions_1","title":"Solution of challenging questions.","text":"<p>\u201cSo there was nothing left for me but to tackle the problem from the opposite side, that of thermodynamics, in which field I felt, moreover, more confident. In fact my earlier studies of the Second Law of Heat Theory stood me in good stead, so that from the start I tried to get a connection, not between the temperature but rather the entropy of the resonator and its energy, and in fact, not its entropy exactly but the second derivative with respect to the energy since this has a direct physical meaning for the irreversibility of the energy exchange between resonator and radiation. Since I was, however, at that time still too far oriented towards the phenomenological aspect to come to closer quarters with the connection between entropy and probability, I saw myself, at first, relying solely upon the existing results of experience. In the foreground of interest at that time, in 1899, was the energy distribution law established by W. Wien shortly before, whose experimental proof was taken up, on the one hand, by F. Paschen at the Technische Hochschule in Hannover, and, on the other hand, by O. Lummer and E. Pringsheim at the State Institution in Charlottenburg. This law brought out the dependence of the radiation intensity on the temperature, representing it by an exponential function. If one calculates the connection between the entropy and the energy of a resonator, determined by the above law, the remarkable result is obtained that the reciprocal value of the above-mentioned differential coefficient, which I will call R, is proportional to the energy. This extremely simple relationship can be considered as the completely adequate expression of Wien\u2019s energy distribution law; for with the dependence upon the energy, the dependence upon the wavelength is always directly given through the general, well-established displacement law by Wien.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince the whole problem concerned a universal law of Nature, and since at that time, as still today, I held the unshakeable opinion that the simpler the presentation of a particular law of Nature, the more general it is \u2013 though at the same time, which formula to take as the simpler, is a problem which cannot always be confidently and finally decided \u2013 I believed for a long time that the law that the quantity R is proportional to the energy, should be looked upon as the basis for the whole energy distribution law. This concept could not be maintained for long in the face of fresh measurements. Whilst for small values of the energy and for short waves, Wien\u2019s law was satisfactorily confirmed, noteworthy deviations for larger wavelengths were found, first by O. Lummer and E. Pringsheim, and finally by H. Rubens and F. Kurlbaum, whose measurements on the infrared residual rays of fluorite and rock salt revealed a totally different, though still extremely simple relationship, characterized by the fact that the quantity R is not proportional to the energy, but to the square of the energy, and in fact this holds with increasing accuracy for greater energies and wavelengths.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, through direct experiment, two simple limits were determined for the function R: for small energies, proportionality with the energy; for greater energies, proportionality with the square of the energy. There was no better alternative but to make, for the general case, the quantity R equal to the sum of two terms, one of the first power, and one of the second power of the energy, so that for small energies the first is predominant, whilst for the greater energies the second is dominant. Thus the new radiation formula was found, which, in the face of its experimental proof, has stood firm to a reasonable extent until now. Even today, admittedly, we cannot talk of final exact confirmation. In fact, a fresh attempt at proof is urgently required.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHowever, even if the radiation formula should prove itself to be absolutely accurate, it would still only have, within the significance of a happily chosen interpolation formula, a strictly limited value. For this reason, I busied myself, from then on, that is, from the day of its establishment, with the task of elucidating a true physical character for the formula, and this problem led me automatically to a consideration of the connection between entropy and probability, that is, Boltzmann\u2019s trend of ideas; until after some weeks of the most strenuous work of my life, light came into the darkness, and a new undreamed-of perspective opened up before me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI must make a small intercalation at this point. According to Boltzmann, entropy is a measure for physical probability, and the nature and essence of the Second Law of Heat Theory is that in Nature a state occurs more frequently, the more probable it is. Now one always measures in Nature the difference in entropies, never the entropy itself, and to this extent one cannot speak of the absolute entropy of a state, without a certain arbitrariness. Nevertheless, it is useful to introduce the suitably defined absolute value of entropy, namely for the reason that with its help certain general laws can be particularly easily formulated. The case seems to be parallel, as I see it, with that of energy. Energy itself cannot be measured, only its difference. For that reason one used to deal, not with energy, but with work, and even Ernst Mach, who had so much to do with the Law of Conservation of Energy, and who in principle kept away from all speculations beyond the field of observation, has always avoided speaking of energy itself. Likewise, in thermochemistry, one has always stuck to the thermal effect, that is, to energy differences, until Wilhelm Ostwald in particular emphatically showed that many detailed considerations could be significantly abbreviated if one dealt with energy itself instead of with calorimetric numbers. The additive constant which was at first still undetermined in the expression for energy, has later been finally determined through the relativistic law of the proportionality between energy and inertia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn a similar way to that for energy, an absolute value can be defined also for entropy and, as a result thereof, for the physical probability too, e.g. by so fixing the additive constant that energy and entropy disappear together. On the basis of a consideration of this kind a specific, relatively simple combinatorial method was obtained for the calculation of the physical probability of a specified energy distribution in a system of resonators, which led exactly to that entropy expression determined by the radiation law, and it brought me much-valued satisfaction for the many disappointments when Ludwig Boltzmann, in the letter returning my essay, expressed his interest and basic agreement with the train of thoughts expounded in it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the numerical treatment of the indicated consideration of probability, knowledge of two universal constants is required, both of which have an independent physical meaning, and whose subsequent evaluation from the law of radiation must provide proof as to whether the whole method is to be looked upon as a mere artifice for calculation, or whether it has an inherent real physical sense and interpretation. The first constant is of a more formal nature and is connected with the definition of temperature. If temperature were to be defined as the average kinetic energy of a molecule in an ideal gas, that is, as a tiny, little quantity, then the constant would have the value \u2154. In conventional temperature measure, on the contrary, the constant has an extremely small value which stands, naturally, in close association with the energy of a single molecule, and an exact knowledge of which leads, therefore, to the calculation of the mass of a molecule and those parameters related to it. This constant is often referred to as Boltzmann\u2019s constant, although, to my knowledge, Boltzmann himself never introduced it \u2013 a peculiar state of affairs, which can be explained by the fact that Boltzmann, as appears from his occasional utterances, never gave thought to the possibility of carrying out an exact measurement of the constant. Nothing can better illustrate the positive and hectic pace of progress which the art of experimenters has made over the past twenty years, than the fact that since that time, not only one, but a great number of methods have been discovered for measuring the mass of a molecule with practically the same accuracy as that attained for a planet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the time when I carried out the corresponding calculation from the radiation law, an exact proof of the number obtained was quite impossible, and not much more could be done than to determine the order of magnitude which was admissible. It was shortly afterward that E. Rutherford and H. Geiger succeeded in determining, by direct counting of the alpha particles, the value of the electrical elementary charge, which they found to be 4.65 x 10-10 electrostatic units; and the agreement of this figure with the number calculated by me, \\(4.69 \\times 10^{-10}\\), could be taken as decisive confirmation of the usefulness of my theory. Since then, more sophisticated methods have led to a slightly higher value, these measurements being carried out by E. Regener, R. A. Millikan, and others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe explanation of the second universal constant of the radiation law was not so easy. Because it represents the product of energy and time (according to the first calculation it was \\(6.55 \\times 10^{-27}\\) erg sec), I described it as the elementary quantum of action. Whilst it was completely indispensable for obtaining the correct expression for entropy \u2013 since only with its help could the magnitude of the \u201celementary regions\u201d or \u201cfree rooms for action\u201d of the probability, decisive for the assigned probability consideration, be determined \u2013 it proved elusive and resistant to all efforts to fit it into the framework of classical theory. As long as it was looked upon as infinitely small, that is, for large energies or long periods of time, everything went well; but in the general case, however, a gap yawned open in some place or other, which was the more striking, the weaker and faster the vibrations that were considered. The foundering of all efforts to bridge the chasm soon left little doubt. Either the quantum of action was a fictional quantity, then the whole deduction of the radiation law was in the main illusory and represented nothing more than an empty non-significant play on formulae, or the derivation of the radiation law was based on a sound physical conception. In this case the quantum of action must play a fundamental role in physics, and here was something entirely new, never before heard of, which seemed called upon to basically revise all our physical thinking, built as this was, since the establishment of the infinitesimal calculus by Leibniz and Newton, upon the acceptance of the continuity of all causative connections.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#explanation-of-new-results_1","title":"Explanation of new results.","text":"<p>\u201cExperiment has decided for the second alternative. That the decision could be made so soon and so definitely was due not to the proving of the energy distribution law of heat radiation, still less to the special derivation of that law devised by me, but rather should it be attributed to the restless forward thrusting work of those research workers who used the quantum of action to help them in their own investigations and experiments. The first impact in this field was made by A. Einstein who, on the one hand, pointed out that the introduction of the energy quanta, determined by the quantum of action, appeared suitable for obtaining a simple explanation for a series of noteworthy observations during the action of light, such as Stokes\u2019 Law, electron emission, and gas ionization, and, on the other hand, derived a formula for the specific heat of a solid body through the identification of the expression for the energy of a system of resonators with that of the energy of a solid body, and this formula expresses, more or less correctly, the changes in specific heat, particularly its reduction with falling temperature. The result was the emergence, in all directions, of a number of problems whose more accurate and extensive elaboration in the course of time brought to light a mass of valuable material. I cannot give here even an approximate report on the abundance of the work carried out. Only the most important and characteristic steps along the path of progressive knowledge can be high-lighted here.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-appendix/#possibilities-for-further-understanding_1","title":"Possibilities for further understanding.","text":"<p>\u201cFirst come thermal and chemical processes. As far as the specific heat of solid bodies is concerned, Einstein\u2019s theory, which rested upon the assumption of a single natural vibration of the atom, was extended by M. Born and Th. von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n to the case of various kinds of natural vibrations, which approached more nearly to the truth. P. Debye succeeded, by means of a bold simplification of the stipulations for the character of natural vibrations, in producing a relatively simple formula for the specific heat of solid bodies which, particularly for low temperatures, not only satisfactorily reproduces the measurements obtained by W. Nerst and his pupils, but is also compatible with the elastic and optical properties of these substances. The quantum of action also comes to the fore in considering the specific heat of gases. W. Nernst had earlier suggested that to the quantum of energy of a vibration there must also correspond a quantum of energy of a rotation, and accordingly it was to be expected that the rotational energy of the gas molecules would disappear with falling temperature. The measurements by A. Eucken on the specific heat of hydrogen confirmed this conclusion, and if the calculations of A. Einstein and O. Stern, P. Ehrenfest and others have not until now afforded any completely satisfactory agreement, this lies understandably in our, as yet incomplete knowledge of the model of a hydrogen molecule. The fact that the rotations of the gas molecules, as specified by quantum conditions, do really exist in Nature, can no longer be doubted in view of the work on absorption bands in the infrared by N. Bjerrum, E. von Bahr, H. Rubens, G. Hetmer and others, even though it has not been possible to give an all-round exhaustive explanation of this remarkable rotation spectra up to now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince, ultimately, all affinity properties of a substance are determined by its entropy, the quantum-theoretical calculation of the entropy opens up the way to all the problems of chemical relationships. The Nerst chemical constant, which O. Sackur calculated directly through a combinatorial method as applied to oscillators, is characteristic for the absolute value of the entropy of a gas. H. Tetrode, in close association with the data to be obtained by measurement, determined the difference in entropy values between vapour and solid state by studying an evaporation process.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhilst in the cases so far considered, states of thermodynamic equilibrium are concerned, for which therefore the measurements can only yield statistically average values relating to many particles and lengthy periods of time, the observation of electron impacts leads directly to the dynamic details of the process under examination. Thus the determination of the so-called resonance potential carried out by J. Franck and G. Hertz, or that concerning the critical velocity is the minimum an electron must possess in order to cause emission of a light quantum or photon by impact with a neutral atom, supplied a method of measuring the quantum of action which was as direct as could be wished for. The experiments by D.L. Webster and E. Wagner and others resulted in the development of methods suitable for the R\u00f6ntgen spectrum which also gave completely compatible results.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe production of photons by electron impact appears as the reverse process to that of electron emission through irradiation by light-, R\u00f6ntgen-, or gamma-rays and again here, the energy quanta, determined by the quantum of action and by the vibration frequency, play a characteristic role, as could be recognized, already at an early time, from the striking fact that the velocity of the emitted electrons is not determined by the intensity of radiation, but only by the colour of the light incident upon the substance. Also from the quantitative aspect, Einstein\u2019s equations with respect to the light quantum have proved true in every way, as established by R.A. Millikan, in particular, by measurements of the escape velocity of emitted electrons, whilst the significance of the photon for the initiation of photochemical reactions was discovered by E. Warburg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf the various experiments and experiences gathered together by me up to now, from the different fields of physics, provide impressive proof in favour of the existence of the quantum of action, the quantum hypothesis has, nevertheless, its greatest support from the establishment and development of the atom theory by Niels Bohr For it fell to this theory to discover, in the quantum of action, the long-sought key to the entrance gate into the wonderland of spectroscopy, which since the discovery of spectral analysis had obstinately defied all efforts to breach it. And now that the way was opened, a sudden flood of new-won knowledge poured out over the whole field including the neighbouring fields in physics and chemistry. The first brilliant acquisition was the derivation of Balmer\u2019s series formula for hydrogen and helium including the reduction of the universal Rydberg constant to merely known numerical quantities, whereby even the small discrepancies for hydrogen and helium were recognized as essentially determined by the weak motion of the heavy atom nucleus. Investigation then turned to other series in the optical and the R\u00f6ntgen spectrum using the extremely fruitful Ritz combination principle, which was at last revealed clearly in all its fundamental significance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoever, in view of the numerous agreements which in the case of the special accuracy of spectroscopic measurements could lay claim to particularly striking confirmatory power, might have been still inclined to feel that it was all attributable to the play of chance, would been forced, finally, to discard even his last doubt, as A. Sommerfeld showed that from a logical extension of the laws of quantum distribution in systems with several degrees of freedom, and out of consideration of the variability of the inertial mass in accordance with the relativity theory, that magic formula arose before which both the hydrogen and the helium spectrum had to reveal the riddle of their fine structure, to such an extent that the finest present-day measurements, those of F. Paschen, could be explained generally through it \u2013 an achievement fully comparable with that of the famous discovery of the planet Neptune whose existence and orbit was calculated by Leverrier before the human eye had seen it. Progressing further along the same path, P. Epstein succeeded in fully explaining the Stark effect of the electrical splitting up of the spectral lines, P. Debye produced a simple explanation of the K-series of the R\u00f6ntgen spectrum, which had been investigated by Manne Siegbahn, and now followed a great number of further experiments, which illuminated with more or less success the dark secrets of the construction of the atom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter all these results, towards whose complete establishment still many reputable names ought essentially to have been mentioned here, there is no other decision left for a critic who does not intend to resist the facts, than to award to the quantum of action, which by each different process in the colourful show of processes, has ever-again yielded the same result, namely, \\(6.52 \\times 10^{-27}\\) erg sec, for its magnitude, full citizenship in the system of universal physical constants. It must certainly appear a unique coincidence that just in that time when the ideas of general relativity have broken through, and have led to fantastic results, Nature should have revealed an \u201cabsolute\u201d in a place where it could be least expected, an invariable unit, in fact, by means of which the action quantity, contained in a space-time element, can be represented by a completely definite non-arbitrary number, and thereby divested itself of its (until now) relative character.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo be sure, the introduction of the quantum of action has not yet produced a genuine quantum theory. In fact, the path the research worker must yet tread to it is not less than that from the discovery of the velocity of light by Olaf R\u00f6mer to the establishment of Maxwell\u2019s theory of light. The difficulties which the introduction of the quantum of action into the well-tried classical theory has posed right from the start have already been mentioned by me. During the course of the years they have increased rather than diminished, and if, in the meantime, the impetuous forward-driving research has passed to the order of the day for some of these, temporarily, the gaps left behind, awaiting subsequent filling, react even harder upon the conscientious systematologist. What serves in Bohr\u2019s theory as a basis to build up the laws of action, is assembled out of specific hypotheses which, up to a generation ago, would undoubtedly have been flatly rejected altogether by every physicist. The fact that in the atom, certain quite definite quantum-selected orbits play a special role, might be taken still as acceptable, less easily however, that the electrons, circulating in these orbits with definite acceleration, radiate no energy at all. The fact that the quite sharply defined frequency of an emitted photon should be different from the frequency of the emitting electron must seem to a theoretical physicist, brought up in the classical school, at first sight to be a monstrous and, for the purpose of a mental picture, a practically intolerable demand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut numbers decide, and the result is that the roles, compared with earlier times, have gradually changed. What initially was a problem of fitting a new and strange element, with more or less gentle pressure, into what was generally regarded as a fixed frame has become a question of coping with an intruder who, after appropriating an assured place, has gone over to the offensive; and today it has become obvious that the old framework must somehow or other be burst asunder. It is merely a question of where and to what degree. If one may make a conjecture about the expected escape from this tight corner, then one could remark that all the signs suggest that the main principles of thermodynamics from the classical theory will not only rule unchallenged but will more probably become correspondingly extended. What the armchair experiments meant for the foundation of classical thermodynamics, the adiabatic hypothesis of P. Ehrenfest means, provisionally, to the quantum theory; and in the same way as R. Clausius, as a starting point for the measurement of entropy, introduced the principle that, when treated appropriately, any two states of a material system can, by a reversible process, undergo a transition from one to the other, now the new ideas of Bohr\u2019s open up a very similar path into the interior of a wonderland hitherto hidden from him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is in particular one problem whose exhaustive solution could provide considerable elucidation. What becomes of the energy of a photon after complete emission? Does it spread out in all directions with further propagation in the sense of Huygens\u2019 wave theory, so constantly taking up more space, in boundless progressive attenuation? Or does it fly out like a projectile in one direction in the sense of Newton\u2019s emanation theory?  In the first case, the quantum would no longer be in the position to concentrate energy upon a single point in space in such a way as to release an electron from its atomic bond, and in the second case, the main triumph of the Maxwell theory \u2013 the continuity between the static and the dynamic fields and, with it, the complete understanding we have enjoyed, until now, of the fully investigated interference phenomena \u2013 would have to be sacrificed, both being very unhappy consequences for today\u2019s theoreticians.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe that as it may, in any case no doubt can arise that science will master the dilemma, serious as it is, and that which appears today so unsatisfactory will in fact eventually, seen from a higher vantage point, be distinguished by its special harmony and simplicity. Until this aim is achieved, the problem of the quantum of action will not cease to inspire research and fructify it, and the greater the difficulties which oppose its solution, the more significant it finally will show itself to be for the broadening and deepening of our whole knowledge in physics.\u201d</p> <p>Next: 6.1.

Subsequently, James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) and Ludwig Edward Boltzmann (1844-1906) established the kinetic theory of gases, making use of probabilistic notions to treat the random movements of molecules. They explained, for example, that on average molecules move faster in hotter substances and that heat is a form of energy due to such random motion. In summary, the kinetic theory of gases indicates that:</p> <ul> <li>Gases are made up of colliding particles that follow the reversible laws of classical mechanics.</li> <li>Gases are not made up of a subtle and continuous, elastic, compressible and extensible matter, but of tiny solid particles; according to Avogadro's hypothesis they were identified with molecules.</li> <li>The molecules of a gas are separated from each other by relatively large distances; therefore, the macroscopic volume occupied by a given amount of gas is mostly empty.</li> <li>The molecules of a gas have great speed; furthermore, they move chaotically in all directions, continually colliding with each other and with the walls of the container.</li> </ul> <p>The kinetic theory of gases introduced concepts such as collision probability, mean free path, energy equipartition and velocity distribution. Nevertheless, these concepts are not enough to explain the irreversibility of macroscopic phenomena. According to Boltzmann, the irreversibility of the movement of the particles in a gas needs to be approached statistically; that is, by considering a very large number of particles and calculating average values.</p> <p>It was Boltzmann who established the connection between the macroscopic states that thermodynamics describes and the microscopic states that statistical mechanics deals with. For example, the entropy (S) of the system is a macroscopic variable that is a function of three variables: energy (E), volume (V), and number of particles (N). These variables are related to the number of microscopic configurations or possible states (\u03a9) such that the entropy in thermodynamics is the function \\(S(E,N,V) = k_Blog(\u03a9)\\), where \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant.</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-6-sect-1/#the-laws-of-thermodynamics","title":"The laws of Thermodynamics.","text":"<p>The name Thermodynamics means: Thermo (heat) and dynamics: the dynamic of heat (the study of processes involving transferences of heat).

This is indeed, what we are trying to achieve when we want to use the affinity between carbon and oxygen to obtain heat.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThis means that at these low temperatures the difference between the specific heats of various substances comes even closer to zero, and thus that the heat of reaction for solid and liquid substances practically becomes independent of temperature at very low temperatures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis fact was an extremely important starting point for Nernst but was still not enough to solve the problem. The new supposition or, as we are now justified in calling it, the new theorem laid down by Nernst which made it possible to solve the problem at hand, stated that what applies to the evolution of heat at very low temperatures also applies to the chemical affinity, or altogether to the magnitude of the driving force in a physical or chemical change, so that at very low temperatures, this too is also almost independent of temperature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith the help of this assumption, which means amongst other things that the evolution of heat in the region of absolute zero is a measure of chemical affinity, it is therefore also possible to calculate this at all other temperatures. This calculation is based on the above assumption and on the known evolution of heat at one given temperature and the known change in this evolution of heat with temperature: this change again, can be calculated, as we have indicated, if the specific heats are known.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThe most significant advance which chemistry owes to Nernst\u2019s thermochemical work might in short be stated by saying that it is now possible to calculate beforehand the conditions under which a given chemical reaction will take place to the extent where a required product will be obtained in sufficient quantities to make the method of production a practical proposition.

In most cases chemical reactions are not complete without an ensuing chemical equilibrium that depends on the temperature. In almost all chemical reactions heat is released or absorbed.

We can thus measure the change in entropy, and from these measurements obtain the data necessary for us to calculate the free energy and heat of reaction of a chemical reaction at a given temperature if we know them at another temperature.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u201cThere is another very important law stating that the entropy is zero for a crystallized substance at a temperature equal to the absolute zero, - 273.16\u00b0.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis law \u2013 the third law of thermodynamics \u2013 first formulated by the German Nobel Prize winner, Walther Nernst, has only now been fully proved as a result of Giauque\u2019s work.

It is here that this year\u2019s Nobel Prize winner has made his greatest contributions to chemistry.\u201d  \u2026. \u201cThis method has made it possible to reach temperatures nearer to absolute zero than was possible by any earlier technique.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cGiauque has achieved many interesting results by comparing the entropy values he has obtained by these methods (calorimetric entropy) with the values he could calculate from the band spectra (spectroscopic entropy).\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>\u201cGiauque\u2019s achievements in the field of chemical thermodynamics and especially his work on the behaviour of matter at low temperatures and his closely allied studies of entropy comprise one of the most significant contributions to modern physical chemistry.\u201d \u2026</p> <p>WORK: \u201cThermodynamics is about heat and its transformation into other forms of energy\u2014basically involving statistical descriptions of atomic and molecular movements. An important but difficult to grasp concept in thermodynamics is entropy, which is a measure of disorder in a system. The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy in a perfect crystal is zero when the absolute temperature is zero. In 1933 William Giauque (1895-1982) used a magnetic field to attain an extremely low temperature and was able provide evidence for the law\u2019s validity.\u201d</p> <p>MLA style: William F.

It is easy for a chemist to write an equation for a desired reaction, but this does not mean that the reaction will actually take place. If one knows the heats of formation and entropies of the substances concerned in the equation, the so-called free energy or thermodynamic potential of the reaction may be calculated. A knowledge of the free energy change permits chemists to determine all reactions which are thermodynamically possible and the extent to which they are possible. When it has been found that a certain reaction should go, but experiment fails, then a catalyst can be sought or the conditions can be altered so as to secure a practicable rate of reaction. If the free energy shows that the reaction is thermodynamically impossible, a search for a catalyst is futile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe third law of thermodynamics, which developed from the Nernst Heat Theorem, states that all perfect crystalline substances approach zero entropy as the absolute zero of temperature is approached. According to this statement a knowledge of the heat capacity, to sufficiently low temperatures, will permit the calculation of the absolute entropy of a substance. It was this possibility which interested me in low temperature research.\u201d</p> <p>MLA style: William F. Giauque \u2013 Nobel Lecture. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2023.

A short historical review emphasizes this.\u201d    </p> <p>\u201cOnsager presented his fundamental discovery at a Scandinavian scientific meeting in Copenhagen in 1929. It was published in its final form in 1931 in the wellknown journal Physical Review in two parts with the title \u201cReciprocal relations in irreversible processes\u201d. The elegant presentation meant that the size of the two papers was no more than 22 and 15 pages respectively. Judged from the number of pages this work is thus one of the smallest ever to be rewarded with a Nobel Prize.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThe great importance of irreversible thermodynamics becomes apparent if we realize that almost all common processes are irreversible and cannot by themselves go backwards. As examples can be mentioned conduction of heat from a hot to a cold body and mixing or diffusion. When we dissolve a cold lump of sugar in a cup of hot tea these processes take place simultaneously.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThe Three Laws of Thermodynamics gradually emerged and formed the basis of this science. These are among our most generally known laws of nature. The First Law is the Law of Conservation of Energy. The Second and the Third Laws define the important quantity entropy which among other things provides a connection between thermodynamics and statistics. The study of the random motion of molecules by means of statistical methods has been decisive for the development of thermodynamics. The American scientist J. Willard Gibbs (1839-1903) who made so many important contributions to statistical thermodynamics, has his name attached to the special professorship which Onsager now holds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt can be said that Onsager\u2019s reciprocal relations represent a further law making possible a thermodynamic study of irreversible processes.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cOnsager\u2019s great contribution was that he could prove that if the equations governing the flows are written in an appropriate form, then there exist certain simple connections between the coefficients in these equations. These connections \u2013 the reciprocal relations \u2013 make possible a complete theoretical description of irreversible processes.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThe proof of the reciprocal relations was brilliant. Onsager started from a statistical mechanical calculation of the fluctuations in a system, which could be directly based on the simple laws of motion which are symmetrical with regard to time. Furthermore, he made the independent assumption that the return of a fluctuation to equilibrium in the mean occurs according to the transport equations mentioned earlier. By means of this combination of macroscopic and microscopic concepts in conjunction with an extremely skilful mathematical analysis he obtained those relationships which are now called Onsager\u2019s Reciprocal Relations.\u201d</p> <p>WORK: \u201cThermodynamics is about heat and its conversion into other forms of energy\u2014basically involving statistical descriptions of atomic and molecular movements. Irreversible thermodynamic processes go in only one direction and not in the reverse. Lars Onsager (1903-1976) analyzed mathematical equations for various irreversible thermodynamic processes and in 1931 found the connection that led him to formulate equations that came to be known as reciprocal relations.

With the acceptance of the atomic theory \u2013 due above all to the works of John Dalton \u2013 the view began to be commonly accepted that what we term heat is merely the movement of the smallest components of matter. Then the invention of the steam engine created an increasingly urgent need for exact mathematical study of the interaction between heat and mechanical work.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThis process of development attained something of a conclusion in the early years of the present century, and thermodynamics began to be regarded as a branch of science whose evolution was essentially complete. However, it was subject to certain limitations. For the most part it could only deal with reversible processes, that is, processes occurring via states of equilibrium. Even an irreversible system as simple as the thermocouple, with its simultaneous conduction of heat and electricity, could not be satisfactorily treated until Onsager developed the reciprocity relations which earned him the 1968 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. The reciprocity relations were a great step forward in the development of a thermodynamics of irreversible processes, but they presupposed a linear approximation. which can only be employed relatively close to equilibrium.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cPrigogine\u2019s great contribution lies in his successful development of a satisfactory theory of non-linear thermodynamics in states which are far removed from equilibrium. In doing so he has discovered phenomena and structures of completely new and completely unexpected types, with the result that this generalized, nonlinear and irreversible thermodynamics has already been given surprising applications in a wide variety of fields.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrigogine has been particularly captivated by the problem of explaining how ordered structures \u2013 biological systems, for example \u2013 can develop from disorder. Even if Onsager\u2019s relations are utilized, the classical principles of equilibrium in thermodynamics still show that linear systems close to equilibrium always develop into states of disorder which are stable to perturbations and cannot explain the occurrence of ordered structures.\u201d </p> <p>WORK: \u201cThermodynamics is about heat and its transformation into other forms of energy\u2014basically involving statistical descriptions of atomic and molecular movements. Irreversible thermodynamic processes go in only one direction, usually toward more disorder. However, during the 1960s Ilya Prigogine (1917-2003) developed a theory about dissipative structures, which maintains that long before a state of equilibrium is reached in irreversible processes, orderly and stable systems can arise from more disordered systems.

That day Max Planck presented to the German Physical Society a work describing his hypothesis of the quantization of energy and introduced the constant \\(h = 6.63 \\times 10^{-34}\\) J.s, which is measured in units of action (energy per time) and which now bears his name. Below, we present in four stages an elementary analysis of Planck's revolutionary contribution to solve a critical problem: energy quantization in the black body radiation.</p> <p>STAGE 1: Description in a common daily language of the basic notions and conceptual relationships required to interpret and solve a given problem. Main antecedents of the problem are described, and its difficulties are considered.</p> <p>A black body is a physical object that does not lose energy by reflection or transmission, only by emission; that is, it absorbs all the energy that falls on it. Since it does not reflect the incident light, it appears to the observer as something dark (black). Depending on the temperatures of the physical objects, they emit radiation visible to the human eye (the color of the object) or in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum such as infrared when the object has been heated. </p> <p>A hollow opaque object functions as a blackbody when its interior walls are painted black and a small hole is drilled into it. All radiation that enters through the hole is absorbed and hardly leaves it. If this hollow cavity is placed inside an oven with controllable temperature, the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted when the cavity is heated can be measured by an external optical device. In this case, for different furnace temperatures the intensity of the radiation measured with a spectrometer is a function of its wavelength, (Figure 5.4).</p>  (Images credit: CC Wikimedia Commons)  <p>Figure 5.4. Diagram of a black body (left) and intensity of the experimental spectrum as a function of the wavelength, at different temperatures (right).</p> <p>In 1879 Josef Stefan (1835-1893) inferred from his observations that the rate at which energy is radiated from a heating body should be proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. Later, in 1884, an assistant of Stefan's at the University of Vienna, Ludwig Edward Boltzmann (1844-1906), calculated the speed of the particles of a gas to obtain the radiation pressure exerted by a piston on the molecules of the gas contained inside a cylinder. From these two contributions, an inference from experimental data and a theoretical derivation, the Stefan-Boltzmann law resulted: when the contributions of all wavelengths are added the total power radiated per unit area of the cavity opening is \\(I(T) = \u03c3T^4\\), where \u03c3 is Stefan's constant.</p> <p>STAGE 2: Contextualized explanation in a technical language of the assumptions and approximations required to characterize the scenario, the objects and the agents that are described in the problem statement. An idea of what the solution to the problem should be is included.</p> <p>According to experimental results, the maximum intensity of the radiation emitted by the black body occurs for a \\(\u03bb_{max}\\) and its position shifts to the left (towards blue) as the temperature increases. This was specified by Wilhelm Carl Werner Otto Fritz Franz Wien (1864-1928) when in 1893 he proposed the relation \\(\u03bb_{max}T = a\\), where \\(a\\) is a constant. This relationship is known as Wien's displacement law (Figure 5.5). </p> <p> </p>  (Images credit: CC Wikimedia Commons)  <p>Figure 5.5. Wien's displacement law that shows how the color of the radiation changes with the temperature of the emitting source for different wavelengths (\u03bb).</p> <p>Wien also proposed a function to describe the spectral energy density (u), or energy per unit of volume per unit of frequency of radiation within the blackbody cavity: \\(u(f,T) = \u03b1[(f)^3exp(-\u03b2f/T)]\\), where f is the frequency, T is the temperature, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are constants. This result is called Wien's power law and is considered in Wien\u00b4s Physics Nobel Lecture (section 5.3 and Appendix 5.1). </p> <p>WORK: \u201cWhen a completely dark body is heated, it emits visible light and other electromagnetic radiation. The spectrum of the radiation is entirely dependent on the temperature of the body and not its composition. In 1893 Wilhelm Wien (1864-1928) formulated his displacement law, which indicates at which wavelength the radiation is most intense at a certain temperature. He subsequently also formulated a law indicating how the radiation spectrum varies as temperature changes. However, this does not apply to long wavelengths, and in 1900 Max Planck formulated a law that conforms better.\u201d</p> <p>MLA style: Wilhelm Wien \u2013 Facts. NobelPrize.org.

Sun. 24 Sep 2023. https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1911/wien/lecture/ </p> <p>Meanwhile, the British physicist John William Strutt, third Baron Rayleigh (1842 \u2013 1919), obtained in June 1900 a formula to calculate the number of free electromagnetic vibration modes per unit volume in the cavity and per unit wavelength. Later, the British astronomer Sir James Hopwood Jeans (1877 \u2013 1946) made some corrections, obtaining the expression \\(u\u03bb=8\u03c0kT/\u03bb\\) for the energy density per unit interval of wavelength, later called the Rayleigh \u2013 Jeans law. This law was consistent with experiments for low infrared frequencies, where Wien's law failed, but for short wavelengths or high frequencies it predicted infinite emission in the ultraviolet, termed the \u201cultraviolet catastrophe\u201d. </p> <p>Later, in an attempt to obtain a general equation, Thiesen, Lummer, Jahnke and Prigshein proposed in the early 1900s a general equation in terms of constants and the parameters \\(\u03bc\\) and \\(\u03b7\\); Wien's law was obtained for \\(\u03bc = 5\\) and \\(\u03b7 = 1\\), while Rayleigh-Jeans law resulted when \\(\u03bc = 4\\), \\(\u03b7 = 1\\) and \\(b = 0\\). Table I summarizes the expressions of the three laws described above, as well as the expression proposed by Thiesen, Lummer, Jahnke and Prigshein as a function of the parameters \\(\u03bc\\), \\(\u03b7\\) and \\(b\\). This Table also includes Planck's law which solve the problem (Figure 5.6).</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>  (Images credit: CC Wikimedia Commons)  <p>Figure 5.6.

Incompatibility between experiments and theories: Consider how the experimental values obtained by spectroscopists are compatible with theoretical predictions only at low frequencies (Wien's law) and at high frequencies (Rayleigh-Jeans law).</p> <p>2. Model of the black body: For each value of the wavelength the intensity of the radiation emitted by the black body only depends on the temperature and is independent of the material of the cavity. Remember that at the beginning of the last century the physical existence of the atom was not yet accepted, nor was there a model of its structure.</p> <p>3. Model of the interaction between the radiation and the walls of the black body cavity: Assumption that the cavity is constituted by a set of oscillators, represented by their characteristic frequency \\(f\\), all of which are in interaction with the electromagnetic radiation that reaches the cavity.</p> <p>4. Quantum structure of the oscillators: If the oscillators are oscillating electric dipoles, classically their vibration frequencies can correspond to emissions or absorptions in a continuum of frequencies. This imperative of classical physics will have to be radically modified when the energy quantum hypothesis is introduced.</p> <p>5. Boltzmann calculation: The set of oscillators represents parts of the cavity in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic radiation contained in the cavity. To account for the energy of these oscillators, the statistical method followed by Boltzmann is applied. He calculated the behavior of an ideal gas composed of many molecules moving rapidly and disorderly inside a container, frequently colliding with each other and with the walls of the container.</p> <p>6. Discrete exchange of energy: The exchange of energies between the oscillators that constitute the cavity and the electromagnetic radiation contained in it does NOT correspond to a continuum of values, but rather, were consistent with Planck hypothesis (\\(E = nhf\\)): the quantum of radiation must be an integer multiple (\\(n\\)) of the frequency (\\(f\\)).</p> <p>STAGE 4: Consideration of the changes introduced by Planck's solution according to what characterizes scientific revolutions (Kuhn, 1962):</p> <p>(1) Changes in meanings of basic terms and the way words and phrases relate to nature.</p> <p>In his initial proposal, Planck spoke of \"resonators\", later he would speak of oscillators. At that time, resonators were mainly identified with acoustics, since electromagnetic resonators had not yet been found. While resonators respond to a single frequency, oscillators can have multi-frequencies and graded excitations. On the other hand, he also changed the term \u201caction energy\u201d that corresponded to an energy interval by the concept of \u201cenergy quantum\u201d. </p> <p>(2) Changes in taxonomic categories used for scientific descriptions and generalizations.</p> <p>Regarding taxonomic categories, the atomic theory was little accepted at that time; furthermore, matter and energy were only conceived to be continuous. It was necessary to obtain experimental evidence for the existence of the atom; only then it became appropriate to think of discrete distributions of matter. For Planck the quantization was a property of the interaction between the oscillators of the cavity with the radiation within it, while for Einstein quantization became a property of electromagnetic radiation in such a way that the photons become the energy quanta of the electromagnetic field. As will be seen in chapter 8 Einstein generalized the concept of a quantum of energy that later on will be called a photon. </p> <p>(3) Changes in metaphors, analogies or explanatory models.</p> <p>Planck solved the blackbody radiation problem by treating it in a similar way to the probabilistic problem Boltzmann addressed. However, Planck started from different premises; his hypothesis of the quantum of energy has no analogue in classical physics. (See section 5.3 and Appendix 5.2).</p> <p>WORK: \u201cWhen a black body is heated, electromagnetic radiation is emitted with a spectrum corresponding to the temperature of the body, and not to its composition. Calculating the form of the spectrum using then-known physical laws gave an unreasonable result; the radiation in the high-frequency area of the spectrum became infinite. Max Planck solved this problem in 1900 by introducing the theory of \u201cquanta\u201d, that is, that radiation consists of quanta with specific energies determined by a new fundamental constant, thereafter called Planck\u2019s constant.\u201d</p> <p>MLA style: Max Planck \u2013 Facts.

Wien based his calculation on an ideal process: the black body was a cylindric oven at a certain temperature, containing in one end a movable piston and in the other end a perfect reflecting wall with a very small hole for the entrance of incident radiation. If an external electromagnetic radiation exercises a pressure on the walls of the piston, it produces a work that moves the piston at a certain velocity. By Doppler effect, the frequency of the radiation reflected by the movable piston is different from the incident radiation already contained inside the cylinder. Afterwards, the change with temperature undergone by the spectral composition of the total black-body radiation in the cavity can be calculated. From this result the displacement law is derived: there is a maximum value of the black body radiation curve for each temperature such that the peak frequency is directly proportional to temperature.

Therefore, \u201cthe radiation energy of a certain wavelength varies with changing temperature so that the product of temperature and wavelength remains constant.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022   As a consequence of Wien displacement law, the color of a star is determined by its temperature.

According to such model, the atom    is electrostatically neutral but not indivisible; it is composed of a heavy positively charged nucleus, surrounded by negative electrical charges, the electrons. Bohr assumed that under stable conditions the electron does not emit radiation even when it circulates in closed orbits around the nucleus. He connected the frequencies of the spectral lines with transitions between different electronic states and proposed a frequency condition: the difference in the energies of the orbits from an initial electronic state (\\(E_i\\)) to a final state (\\(E_f\\)) should be proportional to the frequency \\(\u03bd_{if}\\) of the photon of the quantized radiation emitted or absorbed.

This was explained by Einstein in an article published in Phys.

The null separation between the energies of the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) and \\(2P_{1/2}\\) states was a consequence of having assumed that the only interaction between the electron and the proton of the nucleus was due to a Coulombian potential between such charges.

According to Dirac's theory, these levels should have the same energy (degenerate states) and there could be no radiative transitions between them. These states have the same quantum numbers \\(n\\) and \\(j\\): the radial number \\(n = 2\\) and the total angular momentum number \\(j = \u00bd\\). However, the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are different: \\(l = 0\\) for the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) state and \\(l = 1\\) for the \\(2P_{1/2}\\) state.</p> <p>Lamb and Retherford confirmed that the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) level was above the \\(2P_{1/2}\\) level and that the separation was 0.033 \\(cm^{-1}\\) (about the order of 1000 MHz). The first measured value was 1060 MHz and later on the value of 1,057.845 MHz was obtained. The theoretical calculation made by Bethe in 1947 was 1040 MHz; afterwards the value of 1,057.853 MHz was reported.</p> <p>In their experiment Lamb and Retherford took advantage of two facts: </p> <p>(1) the observed separation between the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) and \\(2P_{1/2}\\) levels turned out to be of the order of microwave frequencies, which fluctuate between \\(10^{-5}\\) eV and \\(10^{-3}\\) eV (the first experimentally measured value was \\(4.4 \\times 10^{-4} eV\\)), and </p> <p>(2) the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) state is a metastable state with a half-life relatively long and does not decay rapidly to the \\(1S_{1/2}\\) ground state, whereas the \\(2P_{1/2}\\) state has a much shorter half-life. When a transition corresponding to a radio frequency is induced from the \\(2P_{1/2}\\) or \\(2P_{3/2}\\) levels, the atom loses its metastability and in \\(10^{-9}\\) seconds it decays to the ground state without emitting radiation.</p> <p>The experimental design consisted of four regions for the following purposes: dissociation of the molecular hydrogen (\\(R_{dis}\\)), bombardment of the electrons (\\(R_b\\)), application of an external radiofrequency (\\(R_{rf}\\)), and detection (\\(R_{det}\\)). Different actions were carried out in each region, which are described below according to the following stages:</p> <p>STAGE 1: Production of atomic hydrogen in the \\(R_{dis}\\) region. The \\(H_2\\) molecules are heated up to 2500\u00ba C in an oven where the atoms dissociate in a percentage of the order of 64%; then the atoms pass through a double slit and hit a diode in a vacuum.</p> <p>STAGE 2: Excitation of atoms at the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) level in the \\(R_b\\) region. Inside the diode a current of electrons are emitted at the cathode and directed towards the anode. Along the way, these electrons bombard the hydrogen atoms coming from the oven and produce excited atomic states, among which is the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) state, which is metastable. The \\(2S_{1/2}\\) states cannot decay to the \\(1S_{1/2}\\) ground state because there is a selection rule indicating that transitions only occur if there is a change in the quantum number \\(l\\), which is zero for both states.</p> <p>After a small recoil deflection, the excited atoms move on to a metal surface from which they can eject electrons and so be detected. Between the bombardment region (\\(R_b\\)) and the detection region (\\(R_{det}\\)) it passes through the region (\\(R_{rf}\\)) where a radiofrequency field is applied.</p> <p>STAGE 3: Application of a microwave field to the excited atoms in the \\(R_{rf}\\) region. The excited atoms are directed to a metallic surface where they produce an output signal of electrons that can be detected. If the frequency of the external oscillating field is zero, the atoms in the metastable state have time to cross the radio frequency region (\\(R_{rf}\\)) before de-exciting. However, if that frequency corresponds precisely to the difference in energies between the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) state and the closest state in energy, such as the \\(2P_{1/2}\\) level, then the atoms in the metastable state will no longer be in that state and therefore fewer atoms will reach a tungsten metallic plate placed after the \\(R_{rf}\\) region.</p> <p>The half-life for the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) state is 1/7 seconds while for the \\(2P_{1/2}\\) state it is \\(1.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\) seconds. Before de-exciting, the atoms in the first state (the metastable) can travel a distance of the order of 10 cm, while the atoms in the second state only manage to travel \\(1.3 \\times 10^{-3}\\) cm and therefore do not reach the metallic plate and will no longer be detected in the next stage \\(E_4\\).</p> <p>STAGE 4: Detection of atoms in metastable state after passing through the \\(R_{rf}\\) region. The atoms that remained in the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) state and managed to cross the \\(R_{rf}\\) region have a long half-life; therefore, they have time to reach the tungsten plate which is sensitive only to atoms in the metastable state. The following sequence of three processes occurred on this plate: </p> <p>(1) the hydrogen atoms are de-excited when they collide with the atoms of the plate, causing the release of electrons from this plate;</p> <p>(2) the electrons are collected and form an electrical current that is amplified and</p> <p>(3) the amplified current is sent to a galvanometer for recording and measurement; when decreases in this current are observed in percentages that vary between 30% and 80%, it means that a transition is induced from the metastable state to another that was no longer metastable and therefore the electron does not reach the metal plate.</p> <p>STAGE 5: Application of an external magnetic field to the \\(R_{rf}\\) region. In practice it was difficult to adjust the frequency of the oscillating field to induce the transition to the \\(2P_{1/2}\\) level, while keeping the intensity of the microwave field constant. To solve this difficulty, an external magnetic field was applied in the \\(R_F\\) region, which produced an extra doubling of the fine structure levels. Under these conditions, the frequency of the oscillating field was fixed and the intensity of the magnetic field was varied. The minima in the readings of the galvanometer indicated the presence of induced transitions from the metastable state to other short life expectancy states, such as the \\(2P_{1/2}\\) and \\(2P_{3/2}\\) states. </p> <p>STAGE 6: Graphing of readings and extrapolation to the null field of the \\(R_{det}\\) region. For a fixed oscillation frequency of the microwave field, a minimum in the current registered in the galvanometer indicated a decrease in the number of atoms in a metastable state arriving at the metal plate. Afterwards, the points with coordinates defined by the oscillation frequency (R) and the external magnetic field (B) were graphed and the value extrapolated to the null field was read on the graph to obtain the separation between the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) and \\(2P_{1/2}\\) levels. Thus, the Lamb shift was determined indirectly as the separation energy \\(\u0394L\\) between two supposedly degenerate levels (Figure. 6.6).</p> <p> </p> <p>Figure 6.6.  Lamb shift measurement: graph of the measured values of Radio Frequency (R) as a function of the applied magnetic field (B). The lines in blue correspond to the \\(2P_{3/2}\\) level, in red to the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) level and in green to the \\(2P_{1/2}\\) level; \\(\u0394L\\) indicates the separation between the supposedly degenerate levels for a null external magnetic field.</p> <p>After having analyzed how the Lamb-Retherford experiment allowed to measure the separation between the \\(2S_{1/2}\\) and \\(2P_{1/2}\\) levels, let us consider what the treatment of quantum electrodynamics consists of, and qualitatively explain such a shift in the previously considered degenerated energy states of the electron in the hydrogen atom. </p> <p>The type of interaction in which an electron emits and absorbs a virtual photon is called self-energy. This implies that a charged particle such as an electron suffers the effects of the field it generates: an electron is itself an electric charge dressed by its own self-champ. Therefore, any electron not only suffers the effect of external electromagnetic fields but is also a source of its own field that produces effects such as the change in the value (renormalization) of it mass and charge. The breaking of this experimentally observed degeneracy of levels was due to an extra perturbation caused by the interaction of the electron field with itself that creates and destroys a virtual photon.</p> <p>Quantum electrodynamics considers in a quantized way both, the energy levels of the electron and the electromagnetic radiation field that includes real photons (those due to external fields) as well as virtual photons (those that exist due to vacuum fluctuations). For example, Figure 6.7 represents an interaction between two electrons (e-) in which the exchange of a virtual photon (\u03b3) occurs.  </p> <p> </p>      (Images credit: CC Wikimedia Commons)  <p>Figure 6.7.

At that time, the real existence of the atom was questioned as a physical component of matter and not as an explanatory hypothesis, uncertain and perhaps unnecessary, useful for codifying certain regularities.

Issues requiring explaining models in Perrin\u00b4s Lecture (1).</p> <p>\u2022   The appearance or disappearance of molecules in chemical reactions imply the existence of a small number of simple indestructible bodies which can always be recovered without any change in their nature: the atoms.  \u2022   The fundamental laws of chemistry concern the discontinuity between chemical species and their discontinuous variation according to the rule of multiple proportions. Understanding these laws requires that compounds molecules contain whole number of atoms.  \u2022   According to Avogadro\u2019s hypothesis equal numbers of heavy or light molecules develop equal pressures at the same temperature and in equal volumes: When gaseous masses, at the same temperature and pressure, occupy equal volumes, they all contain the same number of molecules.  \u2022   Crystallography refers to laws of discontinuity of elementary cells which are repeated periodically along the three dimensions of the crystal lattice.  \u2022   The kinetic theory of gases indicates that matter is made of elastic molecules which are on the average fairly widely separated from one another so that, between two collisions, each molecule can move in a straight line, the duration of the collision being negligible in relation to that of the free path.  \u2022   As Clausius observed, the molecules are all the smaller as the mean free path.  \u2022   Brownian motion is observed when a microscopic particle placed in water (or any other liquid), instead of falling in a regular manner exhibits a continuous and perfectly irregular agitation. \u2026 The Brownian movement (an experimental fact) leads us to the hypothesis of the molecules.  \u2022   A stable emulsion is comparable to a solution. An emulsion is formed when a large number of identical particles (grains) are in suspension in a liquid. It will be assumed that Avogadro\u2019s law applies to emulsions as it does to gases.  \u2022   The law of Van\u2019t Hoff is an extension of Avogadro\u2019s law to solutions: : \u201cEqual numbers of molecules, regardless of the kind, in the gaseous state or dissolved, exert \u2013 at the same temperature and in equal volumes \u2013 equal pressures on the walls detaining them\u201d.  \u2022   In a vertical column of a gas in equilibrium the density decreases as the altitude increases.  \u2022   A non-diluted emulsion is comparable to a compressed liquid of which the molecules would be visible.  \u2022   In a stable emulsion made of equal grains each one of them has an effective weight equal to its actual downward weight reduced by the upward push that according with Archimedes\u2019 principle is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the volume of each grain.  \u2022   The equilibrium distribution of an emulsion is due to the Brownian movement\u2026. In an emulsion the mean square of the horizontal displacement of a grain is proportional to the duration of each free rectilinear displacement. Such displacements are due to a great number of collisions of the surrounding molecules of the liquid with the grain molecules.  \u2022   There is a diffusion for the grains of an emulsion just as for the molecules of a solution. The steady state in a vertical column of emulsion is produced and maintained by the interplay of two opposing actions, gravity and the Brownian movement\u2026 At each level the flow through diffusion towards the poor regions is equal to that which gravity produces towards the rich regions.  \u2022   To calculate the flow produced by gravity, the mean velocity of fall of a grain animated by a Brownian movement is calculated by Stokes\u2019 law, which applies to the uniform fall in a viscous liquid of a large sphere.  \u2022   There exists equality between the mean energy of translation and the mean energy of rotation.  \u2022   Einstein\u2019s formulae were checked by seeing whether they led always to the same value for Avogadro\u2019s number.  \u2022   Different values for the Avogadro\u2019s number were obtained depending on the experimental procedure used: distribution of emulsions analogous to gases, emulsions analogous to liquids, fluctuations in concentrated emulsions, translational Brownian movement or rotational Brownian movement.</p> <p>Box 7.2. Issues requiring explaining models in Perrin\u00b4s Lecture (2).</p> <p>\u2022   Avogadro\u2019s number has been obtained by means of measurements relating other phenomena such as: critical opalescence, the blueness of the sky, light diffused by gases, black-body radiation, measurements of the electric charges of charged microscopic dust or radioactivity.  \u2022   The objective reality of molecules and atoms which was doubted twenty years ago, can today be accepted as a principle the consequences of which can always be proved.  \u2022   Further contributions by Perrin to improve the knowledge of the manner in which matter is discontinuous:  -- in 1895: indication that cathode rays have a negative electric charge and attempts to measure its relation charge to mass;  -- in 1901: assumption that the atom has a structure like a solar system, revealing that the atom as well as the nucleus are discontinuous and have their own components;  -- in 1920: consideration that atoms can be condensations of a whole number of hydrogen atoms, the small differences which exist are explained by the large variations of internal energy which may accompany their condensations;  -- in 1920: indication that the loss of energy which must accompany the condensation of hydrogen into helium suffices alone to account for approximately one hundred milliard years of solar radiation at the present rate;  -- in 1923: interpretation of Rutherford transmutations of elements not as being the effect of an explosive disintegration but on the contrary, as an integration (the helium nucleus combines with the nucleus that it has hit, to form a radioactive atom which soon expels a proton, and that there finally remains an atom which is three units heavier than the atom that has been hit).</p> <p>Next: 7.2.

Before considering a very simplified description of such contributions, let us describe the notion of temporal evolution of a physical system in the configuration space.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Hamilton's principle resembles Fermat's principle; instead of minimizing the travel time of light, it considers trajectories in mechanical systems and minimizes the physical quantity called action, which is the product of the energy involved in a process multiplied by the duration of the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>The evolution in time of a mechanical system is determined when the equations of motion of the system are solved. This mathematical procedure requires the complete description as a function of time of the position of each one of the particles in the system. In the most advanced treatment of Newtonian mechanics, analytical mechanics, a physical system of N particles is described in the so-called configuration phase space, This space is composed of 6N coordinates: 3N coordinates correspond to the components of positions \\([(x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2,y_2\u2026x_N,y_N,z_N )]\\) and other 3N coordinates to the components of velocities \\([(\\dot{x_1},\\dot{y_1},\\dot{z_1},\\dot{x_2},\\dot{y_2}\u2026\\dot{x_N},\\dot{y_N},\\dot{z_N})]\\). In this expression the following notation has been used \\(\\dot{x_i}=v_{x_i}= \\frac{dx_i}{dt}\\) for \\(i=1,2,3,\u2026,N\\).</p> </li> <li> <p>The description in the configuration space is more efficient when generalized coordinates \\((q,\\dot{q})\\) are used instead of the cartesian coordinates \\((x,v)\\). The canonically conjugate variable of \\(q_k\\) is  \\((\\dot{q}) = (\u03b4q_k)/\u03b4t\\), like the velocity associated with the position  \\({\\dot{x}}_{i} = v_{x_{i}} = \\frac{dx_{i}}{dt}\\).</p> </li> <li> <p>Within the framework of analytical mechanics, the Lagrangian function (L) is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy of the system (\\(E_c\\)) and its corresponding potential energy (\\(E_p\\)): \\(L = E_c \u2013 E_p\\). This function depends on 6N generalized coordinates and of time \\(t\\). In this context, the action function \\(S\\) is defined as the time integral of the Lagrangian:</p> <p>\\(S= \u222b_{t_i}^{t_f} [L(q,\\dot{q})dt]\\), where \\(L(q,\\dot{q})\\) means \\(L[(q_1,q_2,q_3,\u2026 q_N),(\\dot{q}_1, \\dot{q}_2, \\dot{q}_3,...\\dot{q}_N);t]\\)</p> </li> <li> <p>As the previous definition indicates, the integral corresponds to adding all possible trajectories that start at an initial time \\(t_i\\) and end at a final time \\(t_f\\). Under these conditions, Hamilton's principle of least action indicates that all the possible trajectories described in the configuration space makes the action variation null; that is to say that \\(\u03b4S = 0\\).</p> </li> <li> <p>Now, let us consider a generalized coordinate system where the Lagrangian L does not depend on a certain variable \\(q_k\\). This variable is called ignorable or cyclic. In this case, the variation of L with respect to such variable is zero, which technically means that its partial derivative is zero: \\(\\frac{\u03b4L}{\u03b4q_k} =0\\).  </p> </li> <li> <p>The previous variational condition is interpreted by saying that the absence or omission of an ignorable variable in the Lagrangian corresponds to a certain type of symmetry with respect to a transformation in space or in time. Noether has shown that if a system has a specific type of symmetry concerning certain mathematical properties of space or time, then a physical conservation law exists when the Lagrangian remains invariant under one of those specific transformations that made invariant the description of the system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Let's look at three application cases: </p> <ol> <li> <p>If the homogeneity of time is considered, the Lagrangian does not depend on this variable, so \\(\\frac{\u03b4L}{\u03b4t}=0\\) and the system is invariant against translations in time. Since the variable conjugate to time is energy, there is a law of conservation of energy.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the case of the homogeneity of space, the system is invariant against displacements in space because there are no privileged positions; this corresponds to the law of conservation of linear momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p>The isotropy of space indicates that there are no privileged orientations, so that the system is invariant against a rotation in space, which implies that there is a law of conservation of angular momentum.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Next: 8.2.

The Physics Nobel Committee explained that such Prize was awarded \u201cfor his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\u201d. However, his Nobel Lecture was related to relativity theories; it was already considered in Section 4.2. </p> <p>In a famous paper On a heuristic point of view concerning the generation and conversion of light, published in Annalen der Physik, 17, 132, (1905), Einstein wrote: \u201cThe quanta of energy penetrate the surface of the material and their respective energies are at least in part changed into the kinetic energy of electrons.\u201d</p> <p>The photoelectric effect consists of the emission of electrons in certain metals due to the incidence of light radiation of certain frequencies; an electric current is generated as a consequence of the release of electrons that were trapped inside the metal.

The stopping potential (\\(V_0\\)) is the potential difference required to stop the fastest electrons, such that the photoelectric current is zero. The quantity \\(eV_0\\) measures the kinetic energy \\(E_c = \u00bdmv^2\\) of the most energetic photoelectrons. This energy is equal to the difference between the energy (hf) of the incident electromagnetic radiation and the energy that the electrons need to be released from the metal which corresponds to the work function (\u03c6) characteristic of the metal. This is Einstein\u00b4s equation explaining the photoelectric effect: \\(E_c = \u00bdmv^2=eV_0=hf-\u03c6\\).  </p>  (Image credit: CC Wikimedia Commons)  <p>Figure 8.2. Experimental device to detect the photoelectric effect (upper left part) and the braking potential as a function of frequency (graph at the right), where the red dots are experimental values. The box indicates the meaning of the physical quantities.</p> <p>The classical electromagnetic theory was formulated by Maxwell between 1864 and 1873. This theory summarizes all the existing knowledge about electricity and magnetism in four mathematical formulas and predicts that the electromagnetic field is a wave traveling at the speed of light \\(c=1\u2044\\sqrt{\u03b5_0 \u03bc_0}\\). Its value is \\(3 \\times 10^8\\) m/s, where \\(\u03b5_0\\) is the electrical permittivity and \\(\u03bc_0\\) the magnetic permeability, both in vacuum. This fact was verified experimentally by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894). In 1887 he showed that light is an electromagnetic wave and discovered the photoelectric effect.</p> <p>Maxwell's theory is a wave theory and requires that the radiated energy be distributed uniformly and continuously in the wave front that propagates from the emitting source to the receiving device. According to this wave theory, light of any frequency should produce photoelectric emission. Given enough time, the illuminated electron could accumulate the energy necessary to be liberated from the metal, even if the intensity of the radiation was very weak. </p> <p>According to classical electromagnetism, for an intensity of \\(10^{-10} W/m^2\\) and a wavelength of \\(\u03bb = 500\\) nm (1 nm = \\(10^{-9}\\) m), around 5 hours should pass before the emission of photoelectrons. However, the first experimental results showed that the emission of photoelectrons was almost instantaneous with an estimated delay of \\(10^{-9}\\) seconds.</p> <p>In the first experiments about the photoelectric effect, carried out in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz and Wilhelm Hallwachs (1859-1922), a well-polished zinc plate was connected to an electroscope. When the metal was illuminated with ultraviolet light coming from the jumping spark of a voltaic arc the ejected electrons could charge the electroscope.</p> <p>In 1899 Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940) and in 1902 Philipp Lenard (1862-1947) independently demonstrated that the action of light on a metallic surface was the cause of the emission of free negative charges that were identified as electrons. Further experimental results needed satisfactory explanations that could not be provided by the classical electromagnetic theory:</p> <p>(1) Increasing the intensity of the radiation increases the number of electrons leaving the metal but did not increases their energy and therefore their speed: the energy of the emitted electrons doesn't depend on the intensity of the light but on its frequency. </p> <p>(2) For each type of metal there is a minimum or threshold frequency below which photoelectrons are not produced no matter how intense the radiation is. It corresponds to a minimum energy to liberate the electron and produce the photoelectric effect. This is the work function (\u03c6) characteristic of each metal. </p> <p>(3) The stopping potential \\(V_0\\) measures the kinetic energy of the fastest photoelectrons (\\(v_{max}\\)) such that \\(\u00bdm(v_{max})^2 = eV_0\\). The maximum of this kinetic energy was independent of light incoming intensity and for certain voltages the magnitude of the photoelectron current reached a saturation limit.</p> <p>Since 1916 Robert Millikan (1868-1953) carried out experiments for analyzing the linear relationship between the variables \\(V_0\\) and \\(f\\) in Einstein's equation \\(E_c = \u00bdmv^2 = eV_0 = hf \u2013 \u03c6\\). After much testing he derived three consequences (see the graph shown earlier in Figure 8.2):</p> <p>1) The ordinate at the origin (\\(f = 0\\)) implies that \\(eV_0 = \u2013 \u03c6\\); therefore \\(\u03c6/e\\) measures the starting energy in electron-volts.</p> <p>2) The straight line \\(V_0 = (hf \u2013 \u03c6)/e\\) has a slope equal to \\(h/e\\). Taking into account that the charge of the electron is \\(e = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\) coulombs, the value of Planck's constant can be obtained by measuring the slope of the straight line formed by experimental data (red dots in Figure 8.2)</p> <p>3) The point of intersection with the horizontal axis (\\(V_0 = 0\\)) determines the threshold frequency (\\(f_0 = \u03c6/h\\)) below which there is no emission of photoelectrons.</p> <p>Millikan published his results in a paper entitled A Direct Photoelectric Determination of Planck\u00b4s \u201ch\u201d. Phys. Rev. 7, 355 (1916). Later, Gerald Holton explained How Robert Millikan experimentally tested Einstein's photoelectric theory in Centennial Focus: Millikan's Measurement of Planck's Constant. Phys. Rev. Focus 3, 23, April 22 (1999). </p> <p>Einstein\u2019s explanation can be summarized as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The energy of the incoming electromagnetic radiation is quantized and is made up of photons.</p> </li> <li> <p>The intensity of the radiation depends on the number of photons whose energy is \\(hf\\). </p> </li> <li> <p>The conservation of mechanical energy law implies that the kinetic energy with which the photoelectrons are released is equal to the energy of the incident radiation minus the energy necessary to extract the photoelectrons from the  metal (work function).</p> </li> <li> <p>There is a threshold frequency below which the photoelectric effect does not occur.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Einstein's explanation fully agrees with experimental results and although he said the same thing as Planck (energy is discontinuous and it goes into packets) it was differently applied. Einstein's original contribution consisted in quantizing all types of radiation and establishing a connection between the wave nature of light (waves with frequency \\(f\\)) and the corpuscular nature of light (photons with energy \\(E = hf\\)). In this way, the quantization of energy becomes a fundamental property of electromagnetic waves: its intensity depends on the number of photons and its energy is a function of frequency.</p> <p>Einstein took up Planck's work and transcended it: the quantization of energy is no longer a calculation artifice for explaining black body radiation but a fundamental physical property of all electromagnetic radiations. If the energy of a thermal oscillator in a hot substance is quantized (Planck's hypothesis), by conservation of energy, the emitted radiation must also be quantized (Einstein's hypothesis). If this quantization condition is valid for the interaction between the incident radiation and the resonators of the blackbody cavity (the Planck oscillators), it must also be valid when electromagnetic radiation is transferred to the photoelectrons (photoelectric effect).</p> <p>It is also important to point out different \u201cphilosophical\u201d positions regarding what the explanation of physical phenomena means: it was the search of the absolute for Planck and the pursue of simplicity for Einstein. The use of Einstein's reasoning is surprising for its originality and audacity, since it gives a very simple explanation of the photoelectric effect: the photons passed their energy in fixed quantities to atoms inside the metal, knocking some of their electrons out of them, so producing an electric current. Furthermore, Einstein solved the discrepancy between the experimental results and the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation by generalizing the concept of photon as tha quantum of electromagnetic radiation.</p> <p>Einstein applied a whole new reasoning process and introduced the revolutionary hypothesis of the quantization of radiation energy (photons). He used the ideal gas model of particles to make an analogy with the quantized radiation model. He considered the entropy change of an ideal gas at constant temperature when the volume changes reversibily. From this he concluded, comparing equations, that the physical behavior of both systems must be equivalent: if the ideal gas refers to material \"particles\", the electromagnetic radiation must also refer to \u201cparticles\u201d, in this case photons.</p> <p>An important application of the photoelectric effect was made by K.M. Siegbahn (1918-2007) who received the 1981 Physics Nobel Prize \u201cfor his contribution to the development of high-resolution electron spectroscopy\u201d.

During the 1980s and 1990s Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, and Shuji Nakamura successfully used the difficult-to-handle semiconductor gallium nitride to create efficient blue LEDs.\u201d</p> <p>MLA style: Isamu Akasaki \u2013 Facts.

No one was able to grow gallium nitride crystals of high enough quality, since it was seen as a hopeless endeavour to try to produce a fitting surface to grow the gallium nitride crystal on.

A few years later, at the end of the 1980s, they made a breakthrough in creating a p-type layer. By coincidence Akasaki and Amano discovered that their material was glowing more intensely when it was studied in a scanning electron microscope. This suggested that the electronic beam from the microscope was making the p-type layer more efficient. In 1992 they were able to present their first diode emitting a bright blue light.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNakamura began developing his blue LED in 1988. Two years later, he too, succeeded in creating high-quality gallium nitride. He found his own clever way of creating the crystal by first growing a thin layer of gallium nitride at low temperature, and growing subsequent layers at a higher temperature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNakamura could also explain why Akasaki and Amano had succeeded with their p-type layer: the electron beam removed the hydrogen that was preventing the p-type layer to form. For his part, Nakamura replaced the electron beam with a simpler and cheaper method: by heating the material he managed to create a functional p-type layer in 1992. Hence, Nakamura\u2019s solutions were different from those of Akasaki and Amano.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDuring the 1990s, both research groups succeeded in further improving their blue LEDs, making them more efficient.

Contrary to the dispersed light of the LED, a blue laser emits a cutting-sharp beam. Since blue light has a very short wavelength, it can be packed much tighter; with blue light the same area can store four times more information than with infrared light.

Mindkind\u00b4s emerging world in cyberspace (2004) where he describes four anthropological spaces. All excerpts taken from this book are written in between quotation marks. </p> <p>Levy defines anthropological spaces as \u201ccultural manifestations of the dynamic evolution that tends to the construction of intelligent communities.\u201d\u2026\u201d An anthropological space is a system of proximity (neighborhood) that defines a space and is anthropological because it is proper to humans. It depends on techniques, meanings, language, culture, conventions, representations and human emotions determined in the social spectrum.\u201d</p> <p>Each space is characterized by a specific transformation which is indicated in parentheses: the Earth (the matter), the Territory (the borders), the Merchandises (the flows) and the Knowledge (the knowledge). These spaces are associated with navigation instruments, objects of knowledge (the figures of the space) and certain technological supports.</p> <p>In what follows we first present L\u00e9vy\u00b4s definitions of collective intelligence and of anthropological space as well as the characteristic phases of the development of collective intelligence. Then, in four Tables we indicate for each anthropological space its main Conceptual developments and Technological applications. </p> <p>Concerning the meaning of collective intelligence L\u00e9vy mention that \u201cCollective intelligence only starts with culture and increases with it. Certainly, we think with ideas, with languages, with cognitive technologies received from a community.\u201d \u2026. \u201cLet us remember that collective intelligence is an intelligence distributed everywhere, constantly valued, coordinated in real time, which leads to an effective mobilization of skills.\u201d </p> <p>Anthropological spaces do not exactly correspond to specific time periods described in timetables; they refer to states of development that can evolve in different moments with diverse types of manifestations. According to L\u00e9vy the following seven phases characterize the dynamical development of the collective intelligence:</p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cListening: Pay attention that manifests itself visibly or audibly both in the community environment and within it, in relation to: facts, ideas, arguments, knowledge, evaluations, inventions, relationships, resources, skills, experiences, demands, proposals, projects .... Dependencies created by official languages, codes or rigid structures must be overcome; authorize singularities and encourage dialogues, rather multilogues. Without limiting ourselves to the passive recognition of differences and the juxtaposition of discourses, it is about understanding the creativity that emerges from the collective.\u201d  </p> <p>\u201cExpression: Expose in an open and plural way the most important problems of the community, take a position and argue each individual position to contribute to collective elaborations that allow exploring alternative individual solutions to such problems, according to the multiple criteria that operate in the community and that are manifested in debates in which all its members participate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDecision: Make visible the collective effects of one's own resolutions to reinforce the feelings and practices of responsibility of individuals and groups in the community, in order to maximize such responsibility, be aware of its consequences and have the ability to make judgments about its legitimacy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvaluation: Value the exploration of alternative individual solutions to the problems of the collective, so that the forms of evaluation are also the subject of permanent debates with responsible and committed participation of community members.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOrganization: Define and distribute functions and attributions to individuals and entities within the community, to share tasks, affect resources and streamline processes, as well as to regroup forces and competencies in order to increase the visibility of the social.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConnection: Promote contacts between senses and human relationships without going through representatives; although disorganizing factors may appear, unforeseen regroupings may arise, desires for collaborations and new exchanges that promote virtual worlds of shared meanings.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cVision: Emergent and global phase of listening that does not correspond to the fixed image of the future, but to the birth of a collective perspective that comes from the previous phases and emerges from the interactions and contacts that arise in common projects; cyberspace allows an indefinite exploration and a deployment in hypertextual mode of virtual images that express the dynamics of the collective.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-II/vol-II-chap-9-sect-3/#conceptual-developments-and-technological-applications-on-energy","title":"Conceptual developments and technological applications on energy.","text":"<p>Next, Tables 8.1 to 8.4 describe the main characteristics of each anthropological space and present a selection of Conceptual developments and Technological applications that are representative of each anthropological space.

Group velocity is different from the characteristic velocities of each one of the component waves of the packet.

A corpuscle has a shape circumscribed to a finite and small region of space where its position at any time can be located, so that its trajectory is observable and measurable.

In fact, a pure sine wave propagates occupying all space: it comes from minus infinity and goes towards plus infinity. Such a wave propagates with a certain velocity in a medium that is material for mechanical waves but that does not require ether for electromagnetic waves. Such propagations are described in terms of wave equations and their solutions allow us to explain interference and diffraction. This does not happen when electrons are considered as punctual corpuscles. Nevertheless, their matter waves are diffracted. Furthermore, an appropriate representation of matter waves requires to superimpose several sine waves to form a packet of waves with different frequencies.</p> <p>By accepting that in quantum physics there is no sharp separation between the classical conceptualizations of waves and corpuscles, we are faced with two disturbing circumstances: (1) when light interacts with matter it loses its wave characteristics related to its propagation and quantized impact and (2) when different components of matter (like particles) interact with radiation, they lose their corpuscular properties and show diffraction.

To get an idea of what Schr\u00f6dinger's equation means, it is convenient to refer to Fermat's and Hamilton's principles (see Section 8.1).</p> <p>The principle of minimum time or Fermat's principle indicates that: \"of all the possible paths that light can take to get from one point to another, it takes the path that requires the shortest time.\" Pierre de Fermat (1601 - 1665) developed this principle around 1650 to explain light propagation as well as reflection and refraction phenomena. He considered that the front of a light wave spends a minimum time to move in different media. About 1744 Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698 - 1759) formulated a variational principle of least action and indicated that the perfection of the universe required a principle of economic operation to avoid unnecessary expenditure of energy.</p> <p>Years later, William Rowan Hamilton (1805 - 1865) proposed that the path followed by a traveling ray of light is minimal with respect to time for wave theory of light or with respect to action for the corpuscular theory. Hamilton demonstrated in 1826 that the study about optical rays can be made in terms of a characteristic function, the action, satisfying a principle of least action. For conservative systems such principle corresponds to Newton's second law. (A more formal discussion of Fermat's and Hamilton's principles has been considered in Section 8.1.)</p> <p>To develop his wave equation, Schr\u00f6dinger considered that if wave optics tends as a limiting case to geometric optics, which can be derived from the application of the variational principle of minimum time (Fermat\u00b4s principle), in the new wave mechanics Hamilton's principle of least action would be the analogue of a \"geometric mechanics\" describing the motion of quantum particles like electrons. </p> <p>Remember that matter waves associated to electrons have wave wavelengths of the order of the Bohr\u00b4s radio \\(\u03bb\u2248 a_0  = 10^{-10}  m=1 \u00c5\\).

Indeterminacy or uncertainty principle refers to an inequality satisfied when the product of the uncertainties of two physical quantities is equal or lesser than h. For instance: the lack of precision in the measurement of the position of a moving particle multiplied by the lack of precision in the measurement of the component of the linear momentum in the same direction of the displacement must be equal or lesser than h. Both measurements must simultaneously be made on the same particle, in the same place and at the same time.</p> <p>As a sort of reconciliation between classical physics and the revolutionary changes of the new physics, in 1923 Niels Bohr proposed a coherent framework for the objective description of nature, his correspondence principle: \"Any new theory in physics must be reduced to the corresponding classical theory, when the new theory is applied to the special situation in which the classical theory is valid\u201d.</p> <p>In the quantum world, the value of Planck's constant is significant; however, when quantum approaches and results are extrapolated when h tends towards zero, the predictions of classical physics must be recovered.

These do not originate, as do series spectra, from individual atoms, but from molecules; and the fact that these spectra are so rich in lines is due to the complexity of the motion entailed by the vibrations of the atomic nuclei relative to each other and the rotations of the molecule as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026\u2026</p> <p>\u201cIt is true we no longer think that the rotation is reflected in the spectra in the way claimed by classical electrodynamics, but rather that the line components are due to transitions between stationary states which differ as regards rotational motion. That the phenomenon retains its essential feature, however, is a typical consequence of the correspondence principle.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Heisenber\u00b4s Lecture The Development of Quantum Mechanics contains comments on the correspondence principle as well as explanations concerning the uncertainty principle.</li> </ul> <p>\u201cQuantum mechanics, on which I am to speak here, arose, in its formal content, from the endeavour to expand Bohr\u2019s principle of correspondence to a complete mathematical scheme by refining his assertions. The physically new viewpoints that distinguish quantum mechanics from classical physics were prepared by the researches of various investigators engaged in analyzing the difficulties posed in Bohr\u2019s theory of atomic structure and in the radiation theory of light.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u2026. \u201cClassical physics seemed the limiting case of visualization of a fundamentally unvisualizable microphysics, the more accurately realizable the more Planck\u2019s constant vanishes relative to the parameters of the system. This view of classical mechanics as a limiting case of quantum mechanics also gave rise to Bohr\u2019s principle of correspondence which, at least in qualitative terms, transferred a number of conclusions formulated in classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. In connection with the principle of correspondence there was also discussion whether the quantum-mechanical laws could in principle be of a statistical nature; the possibility became particularly apparent in Einstein\u2019s derivation of Planck\u2019s law of radiation.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cTo each stationary state of an atom corresponds a whole complex of parameters which specify the probability of transition from this state to another. There is no direct relation between the radiation classically emitted by an orbiting electron and those parameters defining the probability of emission; nevertheless Bohr\u2019s principle of correspondence enables a specific term of the Fourier expansion of the classical path to be assigned to each transition of the atom, and the probability for the particular transition follows qualitatively similar laws as the intensity of those Fourier components.\u201d </p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cIt thus seemed consistent simply to adopt in quantum mechanics the equations of motion of classical physics, regarding them as a relation between the matrices representing the classical variables. The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum conditions could also be re-interpreted in a relation between the matrices, and together with the equations of motion they were sufficient to define all matrices and hence the experimentally observable properties of the atom.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026\u2026</p> <p>\u2026.. \u201cCloser examination of the formalism shows that between the accuracy with which the location of a particle can be ascertained and the accuracy with which its momentum can simultaneously be known, there is a relation according to which the product of the probable errors in the measurement of the location and momentum is invariably at least as large as Planck\u2019s constant divided by 4\u03c0. In a very general form, therefore, we should have</p>  $\u0394p \u0394q  \u2265 h/4\u03c0$  <p>where p and q are canonically conjugated variables. These uncertainty relations for the results of the measurement of classical variables form the necessary conditions for enabling the result of a measurement to be expressed in the formalism of the quantum theory. Bohr has shown in a series of examples how the perturbation necessarily associated with each observation indeed ensures that one cannot go below the limit set by the uncertainty relations. He contends that in the final analysis an uncertainty introduced by the concept of measurement itself is responsible for part of that perturbation remaining fundamentally unknown.\u201d </p> <p>\u2026\u2026</p> <p>\u2026.. \u201cThe behaviour of the observer as well as his measuring apparatus must therefore be discussed according to the laws of classical physics, as otherwise there is no further physical problem whatsoever. Within the measuring apparatus, as emphasized by Bohr, all events in the sense of the classical theory will therefore be regarded as determined, this also being a necessary condition before one can, from a result of measurements, unequivocally conclude what has happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026.. \u201cA visual description for the atomic events is possible only within certain limits of accuracy - but within these limits the laws of classical physics also still apply. Owing to these limits of accuracy as defined by the uncertainty relations, moreover, a visual picture of the atom free from ambiguity has not been determined. On the contrary the corpuscular and the wave concepts are equally serviceable as a basis for visual interpretation.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cFor the clearest analysis of the conceptual principles of quantum mechanics we are indebted to Bohr who, in particular, applied the concept of complementarity to interpret the validity of the quantum-mechanical laws. The uncertainty relations alone afford an instance of how in quantum mechanics the exact knowledge of one variable can exclude the exact knowledge of another. This complementary relationship between different aspects of one and the same physical process is indeed characteristic for the whole structure of quantum mechanics. I had just mentioned that, for example, the determination of energetic relations excludes the detailed description of spacetime processes.\u201d </p>"},{"location":"vol-III/vol-III-chap-11-sect-3/#4-discourse-presented-by-de-broglie-when-he-received-the-1929-physics-nobel-prize-excerpts-from-his-nobel-lecture-the-wave-nature-of-the-electron","title":"(4). DISCOURSE presented by de Broglie when he received the 1929 Physics Nobel Prize (excerpts from his Nobel Lecture The Wave Nature of the Electron).","text":"<p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cFor a long time physicists had been wondering whether light was composed of small, rapidly moving corpuscles. This idea was put forward by the philosophers of antiquity and upheld by Newton in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. After Thomas Young\u2019s discovery of interference phenomena and following the admirable work of Augustin Fresnel, the hypothesis of a granular structure of light was entirely abandoned and the wave theory unanimously adopted.\u201d\u2026... \u201cExperiment also yielded decisive proof in favour of an atomic constitution of electricity; the concept of the electricity corpuscle owes its appearance to Sir J. J. Thomson and you will all be familiar with H. A. Lorentz\u2019s use of it in his theory of electrons.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cSome thirty years ago, physics was hence divided into two: firstly the physics of matter based on the concept of corpuscles and atoms which were supposed to obey Newton\u2019s classical laws of mechanics, and secondly radiation physics based on the concept of wave propagation in a hypothetical continuous medium, i.e. the light ether or electromagnetic ether.\u201d \u2026 \u201cBy an intuition of his genius Planck realized the way of avoiding it: instead of assuming, in common with the classical wave theory, that a light source emits its radiation continuously, it had to be assumed on the contrary that it emits equal and finite quantities, quanta. The energy of each quantum has, moreover, a value proportional to the frequency v of the radiation. It is equal to \\(hv\\), \\(h\\) being a universal constant since referred to as Planck\u2019s constant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe success of Planck\u2019s ideas entailed serious consequences. If light is emitted as quanta, ought it not, once emitted, to have a granular structure? The existence of radiation quanta thus implies the corpuscular concept of light. \u201c\u2026. \u201cIt must therefore be assumed that traditional dynamics, even as modified by Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, is incapable of accounting for motion on a very small scale.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe existence of a granular structure of light and of other radiations was confirmed by the discovery of the photoelectric effect.\u201d \u2026. \u201cNevertheless, it was still necessary to adopt the wave theory to account for interference and diffraction phenomena and no way whatsoever of reconciling the wave theory with the existence of light corpuscles could be visualized.\u201d  </p> <p>\u201cAs stated, Planck\u2019s investigations cast doubts on the validity of very small scale mechanics.\u201d \u2026. \u201cOn the other hand Planck was led to assume that only certain preferred motions, quantized motions, are possible or at least stable, since energy can only assume values forming a discontinuous sequence.\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThe necessity of assuming for light two contradictory theories-that of waves and that of corpuscles - and the inability to understand why, among the infinity of motions which an electron ought to be able to have in the atom according to classical concepts, only certain ones were possible: such were the enigmas confronting physicists at the time I resumed my studies of theoretical physics.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWhen I started to ponder these difficulties two things struck me in the main. Firstly the light-quantum theory cannot be regarded as satisfactory since it defines the energy of a light corpuscle by the relation \\(W = hv\\) which contains a frequency \\(v\\). Now a purely corpuscular theory does not contain any element permitting the definition of a frequency. This reason alone renders it necessary in the case of light to introduce simultaneously the corpuscle concept and the concept of periodicity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand the determination of the stable motions of the electrons in the atom involves whole numbers, and so far the only phenomena in which whole numbers were involved in physics were those of interference and of eigenvibrations. That suggested the idea to me that electrons themselves could not be represented as simple corpuscles either, but that a periodicity had also to be assigned to them too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thus arrived at the following overall concept which guided my studies: for both matter and radiations, light in particular, it is necessary to introduce the corpuscle concept and the wave concept at the same time. In other words the existence of corpuscles accompanied by waves has to be assumed in all cases. However, since corpuscles and waves cannot be independent because, according to Bohr\u2019s expression, they constitute two complementary forces of reality, it must be possible to establish a certain parallelism between the motion of a corpuscle and the propagation of the associated wave. The first objective to achieve had, therefore, to be to establish this correspondence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith that in view I started by considering the simplest case: that of an isolated corpuscle, i.e. a corpuscle free from all outside influence. We wish to associate a wave with it. Let us consider first of all a reference system (\\(x_0y_0z_0\\)) in which the corpuscle is immobile: this is the \"intrinsic\" system of the corpuscle in the sense of the relativity theory. In this system the wave will be stationary since the corpuscle is immobile: its phase will be the same at every point; it will be represented by an expression of the form \\(sin[2\u03c0\u03bd_0(t_0 - \u03c4_0)]\\);  \\(t_0\\)  being the intrinsic time of the corpuscle and  \\(\u03c4_0\\) a constant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn accordance with the principle of inertia in every Galilean system, the corpuscle will have a rectilinear and uniform motion. Let us consider such a Galilean system and let \\(v = \u03b2c\\) be the velocity of the corpuscle in this system; we shall not restrict generality by taking the direction of the motion as the x-axis. In compliance with Lorentz\u2019 transformation, the time t used by an observer of this new system will be associated with the intrinsic time \\(t_0\\) by the relation:\u201d</p> <p>\\(t_0=\\frac{t-\\frac{\u03b2x}{c}}{\u221a(1-\u03b2^2 )}\\)</p> <p>\u201cand hence for this observer the phase of the wave will be given by\u201d</p> <p>\\(sin\u2061[(\\frac{\u03bd_0}{\u221a(1-\u03b2^2 )})(t-\\frac{\u03b2x}{c}- \u03c4_0)]\\)</p> <p>\u201cFor him the wave will thus have a frequency:\u201d</p> <p>\\(\u03bd = \\frac{\u03bd_0}{\u221a(1-\u03b2^2)}\\)</p> <p>\u201cand will propagate in the direction of the x-axis at the phase velocity:\u201d</p> <p>\\(V=\\frac{c}{\u03b2}=\\frac{c^2}{v}\\)</p> <p>\u201cBy the elimination of  \u03b2 between the two preceding formulae the following relation can readily be derived which defines the refractive index of the vacuum n for the waves considered:\u201d</p> <p>\\(n= \\frac{V}{v}=\\frac{1}{1-(\\frac{\u03bd_0}{\u03bd})^2}\\)</p> <p>\u201cA  \u00abgroup velocity\u00bb corresponds to this \u00ablaw of dispersion\u00bb. You will be aware that the group velocity is the velocity of the resultant amplitude of a group of waves of very close frequencies. Lord Rayleigh showed that this velocity \\(U\\) satisfies equation:\u201d</p> <p>\\(\\frac{1}{U}=  \\frac{\u03b4(n\u03bd)}{\u03b4\u03bd}\\)</p> <p>\u201cHere \\(U = v\\), that is to say that the group velocity of the waves in the system xyzt is equal to the velocity of the corpuscle in this system.\u201d ..\u2026</p> <p>\u201cThe corpuscle is thus defined in the system \\(xyzt\\) by the frequency \\(\u03bd\\) and the phase velocity \\(V\\) of its associated wave. To establish the parallelism of which we have spoken, we must seek to link these parameters to the mechanical parameters, energy and quantity of motion. Since the proportionality between energy and frequency is one of the most characteristic relations of the quantum theory, and since, moreover, the frequency and the energy transform in the same way when the Galilean reference system is changed, we may simply write\u201d </p> <p>\\(energy = h \\times frequency\\), or \\(W = h\u03bd\\)</p> <p>\u201cwhere \\(h\\) is Planck\u2019s constant. This relation must apply in all Galilean systems and in the intrinsic system of the corpuscle where the energy of the corpuscle, according to Einstein, reduces to its internal energy \\(m_0c^2\\) (\\(m_0\\) being the rest mass) we have\u201d</p> <p>\\(h\u03bd_0= m_0 c^2\\)</p> <p>\u201cThis relation defines the frequency \\(\u03bd_0\\) as a function of the rest mass \\(m_0\\), or inversely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe quantity of movement is a vector \\(p\\) equal to\u201d</p> <p>\\(\\frac{m_0v}{\u221a(1-\u03b2^2)}\\)</p> <p>and we have</p> <p>\\((p)=\\frac{m_0v}{\u221a(1-\u03b2^2)}= \\frac{Wv}{c^2} = \\frac{h\u03bd}{V}= \\frac{h}{\u03bb}\\)</p> <p>\"The quantity \\(\u03bb\\) is the distance between two consecutive peaks of the wave, i.e. the \"wavelength\". Hence:\u201d</p> <p>\\(\u03bb= \\frac{h}{p}\\)</p> <p>\u201cThe whole of the foregoing relates to the very simple case where there is no field of force at all acting on the corpuscles. I shall show you very briefly how to generalize the theory in the case of a corpuscle moving in a constant field of force deriving from a potential function \\(F(xyz)\\).\u201c\u2026\u2026</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cHere again it is demonstrated that the group velocity of the waves is equal to the velocity of the corpuscle. The parallelism thus established between the corpuscle and its wave enables us to identify Fermat\u2019s principle for the waves and the principle of least action for the corpuscles (constant fields).\u201d \u2026..</p> <p>\u2026\u2026</p> <p>\u201cThese concepts lead to an interpretation of the conditions of stability introduced by the quantum theory. Actually, if we consider a closed trajectory C in a constant field, it is very natural to assume that the phase of the associated wave must be a uniform function along this trajectory. Hence we may write:\u201d</p> <p>\\(\u222b_C \\frac{dl}{\u03bb} = \u222b_C \\frac{p}{h}dl=integer\\)</p> <p>\u201cThis is precisely Planck\u2019s condition of stability for periodic atomic motions. The conditions of quantum stability thus emerge as analogous to resonance phenomena and the appearance of integers becomes as natural here as in the theory of vibrating cords and plates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe general formulae which establish the parallelism between waves and corpuscles may be applied to corpuscles of light on the assumption that here the rest mass \\(m_0\\) is infinitely small. Actually, if for a given value of the energy \\(W\\), \\(m_0\\) is made to tend towards zero, \\(v\\) and \\(V\\) are both found to tend towards \\(c\\) and at the limit the two fundamental formulae are obtained on which Einstein had based his light-quantum theory\u201d</p> <p>\\(W=h\u03bd\\) \\(p=\\frac{h\u03bd}{c}\\)</p> <p>\u201cSuch are the main ideas which I developed in my initial studies. They showed clearly that it was possible to establish a correspondence between waves and corpuscles such that the laws of mechanics correspond to the laws of geometrical optics. In the wave theory, however, as you will know, geometrical optics is only an approximation: this approximation has its limits of validity and particularly when interference and diffraction phenomena are involved, it is quite inadequate. This prompted the thought that classical mechanics is also only an approximation relative to a vaster wave mechanics. I stated as much almost at the outset of my studies, i.e. \"A new mechanics must be developed which is to classical mechanics what wave optics is to geometrical optics\". This new mechanics has since been developed, thanks mainly to the fine work done by Schr\u00f6dinger. It is based on wave propagation equations and strictly defines the evolution in time of the wave associated with a corpuscle.\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u2026.. \u201cThe two mechanics, wave and quantum, are equivalent from the mathematical point of view. \u201c</p> <p>\u201cWe shall content ourselves here by considering the general significance of the results obtained. To sum up the meaning of wave mechanics it can be stated that: \"A wave must be associated with each corpuscle and only the study of the wave\u2019s propagation will yield information to us on the successive positions of the corpuscle in space\".\u201d \u2026. \u201cI must restrict myself to the assertion that when an observation is carried out enabling the localization of the corpuscle, the observer is invariably induced to assign to the corpuscle a position in the interior of the wave and the probability of it being at a particular point M of the wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude, that is to say the intensity at M.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis may be expressed in the following manner. If we consider a cloud of corpuscles associated with the same wave, the intensity of the wave at each point is proportional to the cloud density at that point (i.e. to the number of corpuscles per unit volume around that point). This hypothesis is necessary to explain how, in the case of light interferences, the light energy is concentrated at the points where the wave intensity is maximum: if in fact it is assumed that the light energy is carried by light corpuscles, photons, then the photon density in the wave must be proportional to the intensity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis rule in itself will enable us to understand how it was possible to verify the wave theory of the electron by experiment.\u201d \u2026..</p> <p>\u201cSince the wavelength of the electron waves is of the order of that of X-rays, it must be expected that crystals can cause diffraction of these waves completely analogous to the Laue phenomenon.\u201d \u2026..</p> <p>\u2026\u2026</p> <p>\u201cFor X-rays the phenomenon of diffraction by crystals was a natural consequence of the idea that X-rays are waves analogous to light and differ from it only by having a smaller wavelength. For electrons nothing similar could be foreseen as long as the electron was regarded as a simple small corpuscle. However, if the electron is assumed to be associated with a wave and the density of an electron cloud is measured by the intensity of the associated wave, then a phenomenon analogous to the Laue phenomenon ought to be expected for electrons. \u2026\u2026.\u201dSince, according to our general principle, the intensity of the diffracted wave is a measure of the density of the cloud of diffracted electrons, we must expect to find a great many diffracted electrons in the directions of the maxima. If the phenomenon actually exists it should thus provide decisive experimental proof in favour of the existence of a wave associated with the electron with wavelength \\(h/mv\\), and so the fundamental idea of wave mechanics will rest on firm experimental foundations. \u201c</p> <p>\u201cNow, experiment which is the final judge of theories, has shown that the phenomenon of electron diffraction by crystals actually exists and that it obeys exactly and quantitatively the laws of wave mechanics.\u201d \u2026..</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThus to describe the properties of matter as well as those of light, waves and corpuscles have to be referred to at one and the same time. The electron can no longer be conceived as a single, small granule of electricity; it must be associated with a wave and this wave is no myth; its wavelength can be measured and its interferences predicted. It has thus been possible to predict a whole group of phenomena without their actually having been discovered. And it is on this concept of the duality of waves and corpuscles in Nature, expressed in a more or less abstract form, that the whole recent development of theoretical physics has been founded and that all future development of this science will apparently have to be founded.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-III/vol-III-chap-11-sect-3/#references","title":"REFERENCES","text":"<p>FRENCH, A.P.

An interferometer serves for the observation of interference patterns and for the determination of the lengths of the trajectories covered by each component wave or their corresponding arrival velocities. Some of the most relevant contributions on this issue have been the following:</p> <p>In 1638 Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650) proposed that light was made up of projectiles whose velocity of propagation was infinite. Isaac Newton (1642-1747) suggested that these projectiles traveled in straight lines with very large but finite velocities. Both propositions had in common the fact that light was made of particles. In contrast to previous opinions, in 1678 Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) pointed out that light was a wave and that like sound, it required a mechanical medium to propagate. He summarized his point of view as follows:</p> <ol> <li>All points of the light wavefront act in turn as emitters.</li> <li>From each emitting center the wave moves in all directions with different speed depending on the medium.</li> <li>The medium in which light propagates is a perfect medium, without friction and filling the void; this was the so-called ether.</li> </ol> <p>Huygens explored only the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, in 1800 William Herschell (1738-1822) measured the increase in temperature of objects heated by solar radiation and found that the thermometer heated up even when it was placed outside the visible radiation: the infrared region. </p> <p>Between 1864 and 1873 James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) worked on his electromagnetic theory and conceived light as a radiation disturbance propagating in the ether. This fact was  corroborated by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (1857\u20131894) when he carried out experiments between 1887 and 1888 and considered the existence of a material medium, analogous to what is air for sound, through which the electromagnetic wave would travel: the ether.</p> <p>In 1851 Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau (1819\u20131896) determined how the speed of light was affected by the motion of the medium in which it propagated. If \\(V\\) is the speed of light in air, \\(v\\) the speed in water, then the refractive index of the fluid is defined as \\(n = v/V\\).  In 1849 Fizeau estimated the speed of light to be around 300,000 km/s. </p> <p>In 1881 Albert Abraham Michelson designed an interferometer to measure the relative velocity of the Earth with respect to the ether. Michelson reasoned that if the ether was real, the Earth would move through it like an airplane through the air, producing a detectable \"ether wind.\" Every year, the Earth travels an enormous distance in its orbit around the Sun at a speed of 30 km/s, a little more than 100,000 km/h. Michelson performed the experiments with the collaboration of Edward Williams Morley (1838-1923). They expected to observe interferences if the optical waves traveled different distances or used different times to cover the same distance.  </p> <p>Michelson designed the interferometer and assumed that the direction of the \"ether wind\" with respect to the position of the Sun would vary when measured from Earth, depending on the direction of Earth in its orbit around the Sun. The detection of such ether wind would demonstrate the existence of a state of absolute rest and therefore the ether could be considered as an absolute reference system. Furthermore, according to the superposition of velocities implied by the Galilean principle of relativity, the speed of light will be different if measured in two different reference frames. It is not worth the same if light travels or not in a direction parallel to the movement of the Earth through the ether. </p> <p>The experiments with the Michelson-Morley interferometer (Figure 10.1) consisted of a light beam that leaves a point \\(A\\) and then in \\(B\\) is divided by means of a semitransparent mirror into two perpendicular beams. These beams were then reflected in two mirrors (\\(C\\)) to rejoin in (\\(D\\)) after traveling equal distances but in different directions when they were decomposed in the mirror \\(B\\):  one ray always traveled in the vertical direction, while the other ray traveled part in the vertical direction and part then in the horizontal one.</p>  (Image credit: CC Wikimedia Commons)  <p>Figure 10.1.

A typical interference pattern is shown in the right image.</p> <p>In what follows we refer to the document called Work describing the 1907 Physics Nobel Prize awarded to Michelson. Afterwards, we reproduce an image of his microscope and quote the corresponding explanation given by him, both taken from his Nobel Lecture: Recent Advances in Spectroscopy.</p> <p>WORK: \u201cInterference means that several light waves with the same wavelength can strengthen or cancel out one another, depending on whether they are in phase with one another. In the mid-1880s Albert Michelson developed an interferometer, which uses a semi-transparent mirror to divide up a beam of uniform light waves. After routing the different waves through different channels, the light waves are recombined, and the difference in the distances covered leads to phase displacement, which generates patterns. The instrument is used to measure lengths as well as velocities of light with great precision.\u201d</p> <p>MLA style: Albert A. Michelson \u2013 Facts. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2024.

An ordinary prism spectroscope gives a preliminary analysis of the light from the source. This is necessary because the spectra of most substances consist of numerous lines. For example, the spectrum of mercury contains two yellow lines, a very brilliant green line, and a less brilliant violet line, so that if we pass all the light together into the interferometer, we have a combination of all four. It is usually better to separate the various radiations before they enter the interferometer. Accordingly, the light from the vacuum tube at a passes through an ordinary spectroscope b c, and the light from only one of the lines in the spectrum thus formed is allowed to pass through the slit d into the interferometer.\u201d</p> <p>\"As explained above, the light divides at the plate e part going to the mirror f, which is movable, and part passing through, to the mirror g. The first ray returns on the path feh. The second returns to e, is reflected, and passes into the telescope h.\"</p> <p>The Michelson-Morley experiment was planned assuming that after the splitting of the original light ray in the mirror \\(g\\) of the interferometer, one ray will move in one direction, for instance in the direction of the motion of the Earth, and at the same time the other ray will travel in the interferometer the same total distance but in a perpendicular direction to the previous ray. When both rays coincided in \\(D\\) they arrived with different relative velocities, because to the speed of propagation of light with respect to the ether was needed to add or to subtract the speed of translation of the Earth around the Sun. </p> <p>As the two rays might have different relative velocities, they will produce an interference pattern from which the distance traveled by the Earth with respect to the ether could be calculated. However, no interference was ever found, no matter in which direction it was measured. Therefore, the ether did not exist, and the speed of light was a constant always.</p> <p>Michelson and Morley's experiments failed to demonstrate the existence of the ether. To explain these negative results, in 1889 George Francis FitzGerald (1851-1901) proposed that the interferometer suffered a contraction in its length. In the future, this contraction factor would appear in Lorentz transformations \\(\u03b3= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1- (\\frac{v^2}{c^2})}}\\), where \\(v\\) is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving object and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.</p> <p>The system of transformations proposed by Lorentz represented the possibility of predicting that distances and times could be modified according to the direction in which one reference frame moved with respect to another. If such a modification existed, that would explain the negative result of the experiment by Michelson and Morley, implying that the principle of superposition of velocities implicit in Galileo's transformations did not apply to the case of light. To solve this conflict Einstein proposed two theories of relativity: while special relativity is a kinematic theory of motion, general relativity is a dynamical theory with new properties such as distortion of space and dilation of time: gravitation was the cause that affects motion. Einstein\u00b4s theories of relativity have already been considered in Section 4.2 of Volume I.</p> <p>Next: 10.2.

Gravitational astronomy.","text":"<p>Until very recently the gravitational force had resisted any experimental demonstration that the boson representing its quantum field really exists: the graviton. One of the problems is that the estimated interaction time of this particle is of the order of years. Such times are much shorter for the bosons that correspond to the other three forces of nature. If we indicate these times in seconds, for the photon, the quantum of electromagnetic force, it is between \\(10^{-14}\\) and \\(10^{-20}\\), for the gluon, the quantum of the strong force, it is less than \\(10^{-22}\\) and for the \\(W^+\\), \\(W^-\\) and \\(Z^0\\) particles, the quanta of the weak force, it is between \\(10^{-8}\\) and \\(10^{-13}\\). </p> <p>The quanta associated with gravitational, electromagnetic, and strong interactions have zero mass and infinite range, while the weak force messenger, the gluon, has finite mass and short range. Another fact characterizes the type of propagation of two of these interactions: while photons propagate through electromagnetic waves, gravitons do so through gravitational waves. According to Thorne, next Table 10.1 describes the main differences between these waves:</p> <p> </p>  (Source: Thorne's 2017 Nobel Lecture: LIGO and Gravitational Waves III)  <p>An interference pattern produced by gravitational waves was detected and measured on 14 September 2015, after more than forty years of collaboration of over one thousand researchers from nearly twenty countries. However, it was not reported until February 11, 2016 because its authors wanted to refine their calculations.</p> <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton</p> <p>The detection of a gravitational wave indicated that very far away in the past a violent change in the structure of spacetime was originated by the collision of two massive black holes during a few tenths of a second, more than a thousand million years ago. The difference in masses before the collision (29 and 36 solar masses) and after the collision (62 solar masses) resulted in dissipated energy (3 solar masses) in the form of gravitational waves. Such gravitational waves were produced because two black holes collided and merged.</p> <p>The LIGO detector was just a laser interferometer with two arms forming an L, a beam splitter in the corner of the L and mirrors at the beginning and end of each arm whose length was 4 km. It functioned as follows: light coming from an external laser arrived at the beam splitter after which two signals traveled in different directions and reflected back and forth many times along the interferometer arms. Finally, these signals overlapped in the beam-splitter from where it was registered in a photodetector (see steps 5 and 6 in Figure 10.2) </p> <p>When the interferometer\u2019s arms did not change length, both signals traveled equal distances, and no interference pattern was formed. Nevertheless, gravitational waves shrink and lengthen spacetime and therefore modify the distances traveled by the laser radiation in the arms of the interferometer. Under these conditions the component waves arrived out of phase and produced an interference pattern. The compressions and expansions of space-time generated the observed gravitational wave interference pattern so much expected (Figure 10.2).</p> <p> </p>  Source: Figure 3 taken from the document *Popular information: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2017*.

At the end of each tunnel of length \\(d = 4\\) km there is a mirror that reflects the light coming from a laser. The two beams of reflected light then overlap after traveling an effective distance on each arm that differs from \\(d\\) in very small but significant amounts. By the arrival effect of the gravitational wave, while the length in one arm of the interferometer is shortened, in the other arm it lengthens. Then the light travels different distances in each arm and the electromagnetic waves arrive out of phase at the meeting point where they produce interference.  This effect is amplified if the laser light bounces off the mirrors many times to increase the total distance traveled and make the difference in the lengths of each arm more evident.\u201d</p> <p>In what follows we present some excerpts of the three 2017 Nobel Lectures.

Matter then moves in this new space-time along the shortest four-dimensional paths\u201d \u2026 </p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u2026 \u201cGR also provided some new phenomena open to measurement; small effects difficult to measure but profound in their importance.

In principle, as we have now found directly, one could carry out calculations of massive systems moving at relativistic speeds. Furthermore, gravitational information \u2013 gravitational waves \u2013 did not travel at infinite speed as implied by Newton\u2019s gravity, but travelled at the speed of light as is necessary to be compatible with special relativity.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIn 1916 Einstein wrote a paper showing some of the ideas discussed above by perturbation calculations using linearized versions of his full field equations. It is in this paper he first describes gravitational waves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey travel at the speed of light and are transverse waves much as electromagnetic waves, but rather than exerting forces on charges, they distort space perpendicular to the direction along which they propagate.

Rai covers the physics of gravitational waves, the experimental challenges and some of the pioneering interferometer work. He highlights the experimental challenges and some important early innovations that were proposed, tested at small-scale and have been incorporated in the LIGO interferometers. In this lecture, I describe the LIGO project and, the improvements that led to detection of merging black holes in Advanced LIGO. I also describe some key features of the interferometers, some implications of the discoveries, and finally, how we envision the evolution of LIGO over the coming decade. Kip will talk about some early personal history, theoretical advances that were crucial to making and interpreting the LIGO, and finally, his vision of the future opportunities in this new field of science.\u201d </p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThe basic scheme for LIGO was to use a special high power stabilized single-line laser (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet = Nd:YAG) that entered the interferometer and was split into two beams transported in perpendicular directions.\u201d \u2026. \u201cIn the simplest version of the interferometer, the equal length arms are adjusted such that the reflected light from mirrors at the far ends arrive back at the same time, and inverting one, the two beams cancel each other, and no light is recorded in the photodetector.\u201d \u2026.. </p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cWhen a gravitational wave crosses the interferometer, it stretches one arm and compresses the other, at the frequency of the gravitational wave. Consequently, the light from the two arms returns at slightly different times (or phase) and the two beams no longer completely cancel. This process reverses itself, stretching the other arm and squeezing the initial arm at the frequency of the gravitational wave. The resulting frequency and time-dependent amount of light is recorded by a photo-sensor and recorded as the waveform from the passage of a gravitational wave. The experimental challenge is to make the interferometer sensitive to the incredibly tiny distortions of spacetime that come from a gravitational wave, while at the same time, suppressing the various background noise sources.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe spacetime distortions from the passage of an astrophysical source are expected to be of the order of \\(h = \u0394L/L\\) ~ \\(10^{-21}\\), a difference in length of a small fraction of the size of a proton.\u201d\u2026..</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cLIGO has been a remarkable adventure, beginning with Einstein\u2019s prediction in 1916, and some later wavering in his own belief in gravitational waves. There was a long road, bringing us into the 1950s before the theoretical community became fully convinced of gravitational waves. The experimental part of the story started in earnest in the 1950s when Joseph Weber began the first serious attempts to detect gravitational waves with resonant bars. Some of the early history was marred by false discoveries, but overall, much was learned from the resonant bar era that has been built into the way we approach using interferometers. The concept of doing coincidences from separated detectors to be confident of detections, the analysis of background noise sources is used extensively in LIGO, and finally analyzing off-coincident time slices to measure accidental background levels.\u201d</p> <p>NOTE: Barish\u00b4s Lecture contains detailed descriptions of activities leading to the organization of the LIGO Project.

As a pulse passes over each diffracting point, it scatters a wave, and if a number of points are arranged on a plane the diffracted wavelets will combine together to form a reflected wave front, according to the well-known Huygens construction.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cAlthough it seemed certain that the von Laue effect was due to the diffraction of very short waves, there remained the possibility that there might not be the X-rays.\u201d \u2026..</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u201cIn examining the effect for varying angles of incidence my father discovered that a very strong reflection appeared when a given crystal face was set at certain definite angles.\u201d \u2026</p> <p>\u201cThe results obtained with the spectrometer gave the frequency of these radiations, and my father was able to show that the product of the frequency and Planck\u2019s constant h was equal to the cathode-ray energy required to excite the rays; this was a first proof of the quantum law as applied to X-rays.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThe examination of crystal structure, with the aid of X-rays has given us for the first time an insight into the actual arrangement of the atoms in solid bodies. The study of structure by means of a microscope is limited by the coarseness of the light which illuminates the object, for we can never hope to see details smaller than the wavelength of the light. By using X-rays with their very short wavelengths, this limit of minuteness has at one step been decreased ten thousand times, for the wavelength of the X-rays is of a smaller order than the dimensions of the atomic structure. We are actually looking into the interior of the molecule and the atom with this fine-grained form of light.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u2026.. \u201cWe find the angle at which a monochromatic beam of X-rays of known wavelength is reflected by the various faces of the crystal. Reflection takes place only when the relation \\(n\u03bb = 2dsin(\u03b8)\\) is satisfied, and so the spacing \\(d\\) of the planes parallel to any face under examination can be found by measuring the angle \\(\u03b8\\).\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cIn our early work we made certain assumptions in order to unravel the complex tangle which the reflexions from some crystals represented. We supposed that the diffraction took place at the centre of each atom, as if the whole effect were localized there. Further, we supposed that the effect of an atom was proportional to its atomic weight.\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThere seems to be hardly any type of matter in the condition of a true solid which we cannot attempt to analyze by means of X-rays. For the first time the exact arrangement of the atoms in solids has become known; we can see how far the atoms are apart and how they are grouped. The importance of this consists in the light it throws on chemical composition.\u201d \u2026</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cFinally, there is a still deeper application of the X-ray analysis, to the structure of the atom itself. Since the wavelength of the X-rays is less than the \"atomic diameter\", as it is somewhat vaguely termed, and since the rays are presumably diffracted by the electrons in the atom, we ought to be able to get some idea of the distribution of these electrons in the same way that we draw conclusions as to the grouping of the atoms.\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>For more information consult the document Speed read: Crystal Patterns Made Plane and Simple. </p> <p>MLA style: Lawrence Bragg \u2013 Nobel Lecture.

Instead of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, Haroche and Wineland trap quantum particles and put them in cat-like superposition states.

Entanglement has also been described by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and can occur between two or more quantum particles that have no direct contact but still can read and affect the properties of each other. Entanglement of the microwave field and Rydberg atoms allowed Haroche to map the life and death of the cat-like state inside his cavity, following it step by step, atom by atom, as it underwent a transition from the quantum superposition of states to a well defined state of classical physics.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-III/vol-III-chap-13-sect-2/#on-the-verge-of-a-new-computer-revolution","title":"On the verge of a new computer revolution.","text":"<p>\u201cA possible application of ion traps that many scientists dream of is the quantum computer.

Boson condensation.","text":"<p>Statistical mechanics is a branch of physics in which statistical calculations of microscopic variables are related to macroscopic observables. The probability that something happens in a physical system depends on the number of possible configurations describing the structure and dynamics of the system. How configurations are counted depends on what kind of assumptions and criteria are applied according to classical physics or to modern physics.</p> <p>In classical mechanics the particles of a physical system can be distinguished from each other and are localizable by specifying simultaneously their vectors of position (\\(r\\)) and momentum (\\(p = mv\\)). To count configurations of particles with such properties we speak of classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics (MB).</p> <p>In quantum mechanics the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (\\(\u0394x \u0394p_x\\) ~ \\(h\\)) must be satisfied and the positions of the N particles of the system are described in probabilistic terms by the wave function \\(\u03a8(r_1, r_2,  r_3,...  r_N)\\). Two situations may arise with respect to the exchange of positions between two of the components of the system: the symmetric case characterizing bosons corresponds to Bose-Einstein statistics (BE) where \\(\u03a8(r_1, r_2, r_3,... r_N) = (+)\u03a8(r_2, r_1, r_3,... r_N)\\), while the antisymmetric case characterizing fermions corresponds to the so-called Fermi-Dirac (FD) statistic where \\(\u03a8(r_1, r_2, r_3,... r_N) = (-)\u03a8(r_2, r_1, r_3,...  r_N)\\).  </p> <p>Fermions have half-integral spin, they are selective and obey the exclusion principle; a gas of fermions have at most one particle in each one-particle quantum states. Bosons have integral spin, they are gregarious and can condense in a quantum state described by one and the same wavefunction; below a certain critical temperature they form a Bose-Einstein condensate.</p> <p>In June 4, 1924 Albert Einstein (1879-1995) received a letter from Satyendra Nath Bose (1894-1977) explaining that a recent paper written by him was rejected for publication. He had worked on a derivation of Planck\u00b4s law of black-body radiation by introducing a new procedure for the coarse-grained counting in the phase space. Accompanying his letter Bose sent a translation in English of his rejected paper and asked Einstein, that in case he might think the work had sufficient merit, to arrange it for a publication in a German journal. </p> <p>Einstein did the translation and submitted the paper including the following translator\u00b4s note: \u201cIn my opinion, Bose\u00b4s derivation of the Planck formula constitutes an important advance. The method used here also yields the quantum theory of the ideal gas, as I shall discuss elsewhere in more detail\u201d. Probably Einstein was thinking on his paper Quantum Theory of the Monatomic Ideal Gas to be published in the journal Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Physikalisch-mathematische Klasse, 1924, 261\u2013267. </p> <p>Bose described certain rules for determining if two photons could be considered as identical or as different particles. Einstein applied these rules to the atoms of a gas and considered that at very low temperatures most of these atoms were in the same quantum state, the fundamental state where the energy attains the minimum possible value. In those circumstances no one could differentiate the components of such a group of atoms. This process is like to what happens when a gas forms a drop by changing the phase from vapor to liquid. Both systems experience condensation.</p> <p>Bose-Einstein condensation is a new state of matter, a state of microscopic quantum coherence. When the atoms are cooled down near absolute zero, their quantum wave functions begin to overlap and the atoms lose their individual identities, behaving more like a single super-atom than an agglomeration of distinct atoms glued together. All these atoms occupy the same position with an almost null momentum. They satisfy Heisenberg\u00b4s indeterminacy principle.</p> <p>At the time of the publication of Bose and Einstein papers the possibility of observing boson condensation was considered as having \u201ca purely imaginary character\u201d, also with no possible connections with unknown effects like superconductivity or superfluidity. These effects were experimentally discovered before their satisfactory theoretical explanations were available. Let us follow the sequence in time of this conceptual trajectory whose main steps are the condensates formed by bosons in these conditions: pairs of electrons in superconductivity, pair of atoms of He-3 in superfluidity and atoms of alkali gases like rubidium and sodium in Bose-Einstein condensation.</p> <p>In 1908 Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (1853-1926) obtained liquid helium for the first time; afterwards it will be used as refrigerant. In 1911 he discovered superconductivity when he observed the sudden nullification of the electrical resistance of mercury at 4.2\u00b0 K.

In 1908 Heike Kamerlingh Onnes used an ingenious apparatus to cool helium to liquid form. Fluid helium was carefully studied and also became an important aid for the cooling of different substances and charting their properties at low temperatures. In 1911 Kamerlingh Onnes discovered that the electrical resistance of mercury completely disappeared at temperatures a few degrees above absolute zero.

From 1/500 the resistance at 4.2\u00b0K drops to a millionth part. At the lowest temperature, 1.5\u00b0K, it could be established that the resistance had become less than a thousand-millionth part of that at normal temperature.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>(Source: taken from Kammerling Onnes\u00b4s Nobel Lecture Investigations into the properties of substances at low temperatures, which have led, amongst other things, to the preparation of liquid helium.)</p> <p>Figure 12.1. Experimental demonstration of superconductivity in mercury.</p> <p>In 1926 Willem Keesom (1876-1956), a student of Kamerlingh Onnes, invented a method to freeze liquid helium and years later he discovered a phase transition in Helium at 2.19\u00b0 K. </p> <p>In 1933 Walther Meissner (1882 \u2013 1974) and Robert Ochsenfeld (1901 \u20131993) discovered what is now called the Meissner effect: a superconductor placed in a weak external magnetic field expels the magnetic field when it is cooled at the transition temperature. Due to this effect a magnet can levitate above a cooled superconductor. </p> <p>In 1934 Piotr Kapitsa (1894-1984) developed a method for producing liquid helium in large quantities, and in 1937 he discovered that at very low temperatures liquid helium can flow through narrow channels with complete absence of friction, without resistance. Since then, this property was called superfluidity.</p> <p>The inert gas helium exists in two forms or isotopes: He-3 whose nucleus has two protons and one neutron, and He-4 with a nucleus with two protons and two neutrons. To balance the atomic charge of the complete atom, both isotopes have two electrons in the surrounding electronic shell. The total number of particles serves to classify helium atoms: those called fermions have an unpair number (3) as in He-3 and those called bosons have a pair number (4) as in He-4. </p> <p>Nearly absolute zero (-273.15\u00b0 C) there is no more randomness in the motion of atoms, they now move together in a coordinated fashion. Thereafter atoms do not acquire energy by friction and then do not dissipate energy. The liquid is no longer a classic liquid, it is a quantum superfluid, meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.</p> <p>In 1935, the brothers Fritz London (1900-1954) and Heinz London (1907-1970) explained the Meissner effect as a consequence of the minimization of the electromagnetic free energy carried by a superconducting current. </p> <p>In 1939 Fritz London proposed an interpretation of the He3 \u2013 He-4 phase transition as a Bose-Einstein condensation.</p> <p>In 1941 Lev Landau (1908-1968) studied the movement of superfluid liquid helium and considered the quantized states of motion of the whole liquid by introducing the concept of quasiparticles. The superfluid liquid is a kind of Bose-Einstein condensate of helium atoms.</p> <p>In 1950 Landau in collaboration with Vitaly Ginzburg (1916-2009) proposed the phenomenological Ginzburg- Landau theory to explain superconductivity. This theory is a combination of Landau's theory of second-order phase transition with a Schr\u00f6dinger-like wave equation.  </p> <p>Landau was recognized with the Physics Nobel Prize in 1962 and Ginzburg shared with Alexei A.

When an electric current flows through a conductor like a thin gold plate which is located in a magnetic field, this field exerts a transverse force on the carrier of moving charges, which tends to push them to one side of the conductor. The accumulation of charges on the sides of the conductor will balance the magnetic force, producing a measurable voltage between the two sides of the conductor. Such a potential drop is at right angles both to the current and the magnetic field. Hall performed his experiments at room temperature and with moderate magnetic fields of less than one tesla (T).

At very low temperatures the electrons moved as in two dimensions only, and changes in the magnetic field resulted in changes in the Hall conductance that does not vary in linear fashion, but \u201cstepwise\u201d. The quantized values of the Hall resistance \\(R_H\\) were \\((h/e2)/f\\), where \\(h\\) is Planck\u2019s constant, \\(e\\) is the elementary charge of the electron and \\(f\\) (the filling factor) is an integer number. According to von Klitzing, the fact that normal Ohmic resistance disappeared was an indication that the material became a sort of a superconductor. Next Figures 12.8 and 12.9 come from his NOBEL LECTURE The Quantized Hall Effect.</p> <p> </p> <p>Figure 12.8. Experimental conditions for observing the quantized Hall effect.</p> <p> </p> <p>Figure 12.9. Experimental results reported in von Klitzing Nobel Lecture; (\\(h\\) is Planck constant and \\(e\\) the charge of the electron).</p> <p>In experiments with the electron gas realized during 1982-1983, St\u00f6rmer and Tsui worked on more severe conditions of temperatures and magnetic fields (around -272\u00b0C and nearly 30 T). Although the electrons are most reluctant to condense (they are fermions) they combine with the \u201cflux quanta\u201d of the magnetic field and form composite particles that can condense (they become bosons). St\u00f6rmer and Tsui found Hall plateaus at high magnetic field strengths corresponding to fractional values of the filling factor \\(f\\). This implied the existence of quasiparticles carrying fractional charge; for instance if \\(f=1/3\\) this would correspond to a fractional charge of \\(e/3\\).</p> <p>In his 1998 Nobel Lecture \\(The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\\) St\u00f6rmer explains the main difference between IQHE (Integer Quantum Hall Effect) and FQHE (Fractional Quantum Hall Effect): \u201cThe IQHE can be understood solely on the basis of the quantized motion of individual 2D electrons in the presence of a magnetic field and random fluctuations of the interface potential which creates localized states. \u2026. The origin of FQHE is interaction between electrons. It is therefore termed a many-particle effect or an electron correlation effect, since the charged electrons avoid each other by correlating their relative motion in an intricate manner.\u201d (See Figure 12.10 taken from St\u00f6rmer\u00b4s Nobel Lecture.)</p> <p> </p> <p>(Source: MLA style: Horst L.

Hall Resistance (\\(R_H\\)) showing many fractional values.</p> <p>Although the electrons usually repel each other because they are fermions, according to Laughlin the reported fractional quantization was because in the presence of very strong magnetic fields the electron gas behaved as a new type of quantum fluid integrated by composite interacting fermions (the electrons) that behave as bosons and condense as fractionally charged \u201cquasiparticles\u201d. Laughlin, closed his Nobel lecture Fractional Quantization by saying: \u201cFractional quantum Hall quasiparticles are the elementary excitations of a distinct state of matter that cannot be deformed into noninteracting electrons without crossing a phase boundary. That means they are different from electrons in the only sensible way we have of defining different, and in particular are not adiabatic images of electrons the way quasiparticle excitations of metals and band insulators are.\u201d</p> <p>Next: 12.3.

Furthermore, the performance of critical experiments served to create new materials like graphene and to introduce powerful methods for the individual control of photons or ions. Graphene is a virtually perfect two-dimensional lattice and one atom thick. For its discovery A. Geim and K. Novoselov received a Physics Nobel Prize. Geim\u00b4s Nobel Lecture Random Walk to Graphene is analyzed in terms of a learning and research process that involves two structural phases: the learning phase for inquiring and exploring and the research phase for evaluating and communicating. </p> <p>Single particles are not easily isolated in the quantum domain because they lose their properties as soon as they interact with their surrounding environment. However, research groups leaded by S. Haroche and D.J. Wineland have independently observed, examined, controlled, and counted individual quantum particles without destroying them.

Several condensates can be formed by bosons like pairs of electrons in superconductivity, pair of atoms of He-3 in superfluidity and atoms of alkali gases like rubidium and sodium in Bose-Einstein condensation. According to Ginzburg, \u201csuperconductivity is the superfluidity of a charged liquid or, equivalently, superfluidity is the superconductivity of a noncharged liquid\u201d. Einstein predicted the phenomena of condensation in a paper published in July 1924; nevertheless, the phenomena was experimentally discovered till 1994 by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle. In connection with this prediction, it is worthwhile considering how prescriptive learning and emergent learning were present in Einstein\u00b4s life.</p> <p>The Hall effect is produced when a magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to a metal strip causing electrons to distribute along both ends of the strip, creating a voltage. A century later, in 1980 von Klitzing discovered that this voltage is quantized (the quantum Hall effect). Later, in 1982-83, the fractional quantum Hall effect was discovered experimentally by St\u00f6rmer and Tsui and theoretically explained by Laughlin. Although the electrons usually repel each other because they are fermions, fractional quantization was produced because the electron gas behaved as a quantum fluid composed by fermions that can condense and are produced by fractionally charged \u201cquasiparticles\u201d.</p> <p>In connection with previous reported contributions, Physics Nobel Prizes have been awarded to J.

Around that time Karl Schwarzschild described how heavy masses can bend space and time. Einstein predicted that extremely heavy objects could form a black hole by encapsulating a singularity in space. Blach holes are surrounded by an event horizon that sweeps around the mass at its center like a veil that hides the black hole.</p> </li> <li> <p>In 1930s Robert Oppenheimer calculated how a massive gigantic star explodes as a supernova when it is run out of fuel and then collapses into extremely densely packed remnants, so heavy that gravity pulls everything inside, even light.</p> </li> <li> <p>In 1963, the identification of the radio source 3C 48 signaled the discovery of a quasar: a \u201cquasi-stellar radio source\u201d.  These are the brightest objects in the universe; it is assumed that they are luminous active galactic nucleus whose radiant electromagnetic energy is powered by a supermassive black hole surrounded by a gaseous hot accretion disc.</p> </li> <li> <p>In 1965 Roger Penrose proved that the existence of black holes was a direct consequence of the general theory of relativity. He analyzed the inner structure of black holes and studied the gravitational conditions that nearby the immediate vicinity of those invisible objects capture everything that enters them. Penrose conceived the notion of trapped force as a mathematical tool needed to describe what happens in a black hole when all incoming radiation points toward its center, hiding a singularity, a boundary where time and space end.

Conversely, a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron with a neutrino in the so-called positron emission.

Later, such extra particle was named neutrino by Fermi.</p> </li> <li> <p>In 1974 Martin Perl and collaborators discovered the tau (\\(\u03c4\\)) particle and assumed the existence of the tau neutrino (\\(\u03bd_\u03c4\\)). The existence of a triplet of neutrinos is because a neutrino collides with an atomic nucleus and an electron, a muon or a tauon is produced, then neutrinos of the electronic, muonic or tauonic type are generated.</p> </li> <li> <p>The mechanisms of neutrino production are multiple: reactions of cosmic radiation in the Earth's atmosphere, radioactive decay, reactions in nuclear plants, supernova explosions, death of massive stars, or production of nuclear reactions in the interior of the Sun. Most neutrinos that reach Earth come from the latter mechanism and are of the electron neutrino type. This is due to a fusion process in which helium is obtained from hydrogen, producing two neutrinos for each helium nucleus.</p> </li> <li> <p>If only electron neutrinos are released from the Sun and it turns out that a smaller number reach the Earth than calculated, it is possible that in that trip of 150 million kilometers some electron neutrinos will be lost; that is, they are transformed into other types of neutrinos that are no longer detected. The first results indicated differences of the order of 34% and in subsequent experiments these differences reached up to 66%. This means that neutrinos change their identity when traveling. The possibility of this transformation in neutrino identity was predicted by Bruno Pontecorvo in 1957 and constitutes what is called neutrino oscillation.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Two sets of experiments have been conclusive in detecting neutrino oscillations: the experiments started in 1986 at the SuperKamiokande detector in Japan to record changes in neutrinos generated in the atmosphere and those started a few years later at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada to detect neutrinos coming from the Sun. With some differences in details, both experiments were carried out in mines about a thousand meters below the Earth where tanks with 50,000 tons of heavy water and of the order of ten thousand to eleven thousand light detectors were installed on the interior walls, base, and cover of the tank. The first Japanese results on the existence of neutrino oscillations were reported in 1996 while the Canadian results were published in 2001.</p> </li> <li> <p>After crossing the earth's surface the neutrinos reach the tank and interact with the water molecules, then charged particles (electrons or muons) are produced, which in turn generate radiation that is registered in the light detectors. These signals are then amplified, recorded, and accounted for. The shape and intensity of the generated radiation indicated the type of neutrino and from where it came from. The conclusion in both experiments was the same: neutrinos present oscillations indicating that at least one of the neutrinos in the triplet has mass, which contradicts what is predicted by the Standard Model that assumes that neutrinos lack mass.</p> </li> <li> <p>The two experiments confirmed the suspicion that neutrinos can change from one identity to another. We have here a problem of interpretation that might be explained in quantum terms: the electron-neutrino, muon-neutrino and tau-neutrinos are represented by superposed waves that correspond to neutrino states with different masses. The superposition in any given location yields the probability for what type of neutrino is most likely to be found there. The probabilities vary from one location to another, they oscillate, and the neutrinos appear in their various identities having different masses. When the waves are in phase it is not possible to distinguish the different neutrino states from each other; when neutrinos travel through space the waves go out of phase and along the way the waves are superposed in varying ways. This is a quantum metamorphosis process.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"vol-IV/vol-IV-chap-17-sect-2/#description-of-the-physics-nobel-prize-awarded-to-kajita-and-mcdonald","title":"Description of the Physics Nobel Prize awarded to Kajita and McDonald.","text":"<p>WORK (Kajita): \u201cThe Standard Model used by modern physics has three types of a very small and elusive particle called the neutrino.

This relation has served as a cosmic benchmarks for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances.  </p> </li> <li> <p>In 1917 Albert Einstein (1879-1955) introduced a term called the cosmological constant to counterbalance the effect of gravity to obtain a static universe as a solution of his general relativity equations. So in order to stop the unwanted cosmic expansion, he added a constant term to his equations, the cosmological constant, which had the effect of a repulsive force against the gravitational attraction of matter.</p> </li> <li> <p>In 1927 Georges Lemaitre (1894-1966) proposed a theory explaining the expansion of the universe, even indicating that such expansion was accelerated. In 1929 he published a paper untitled Un Univers homog\u00e8ne de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des n\u00e9buleuses extragalactiques. (A homogeneous Universe of constant mass and growing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extragalactic nebulae).</p> </li> <li> <p>In 1998 two radio astronomy teams report observations of supernovae Ia indicating that the universe was expanding rapidly: the Supernova Cosmology Project that began work in 1988 led by Saul Perlmutter and the High-z Supernova Search Team that began in 1994, led by Brian Schmidt with the collaboration of Adam Riess. These research teams were working to trace a map the Universe by locating the most distant supernovae.</p> </li> <li> <p>These two research teams reported the detection of signals from explosions of a certain type of supernovae, the so-called Supernovae Ia, which was the product of the explosion of a binary system of white dwarf stars. In a system of two stars, when the lower-mass star begins to take mass away from the other star and reaches a limit value of 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, the system becomes unstable, and an observable thermonuclear explosion occurs.</p> </li> <li> <p>The supernova Ia was as heavy as the Sun but as small as the Earth; it emitted as much light as an entire galaxy.  In a typical galaxy only one or two supernova explosions occur in a thousand years. Nevertheless, in September 2011, one such supernova was observed in a galaxy close to the Big Dipp.</p> </li> <li> <p>The two research teams of astronomers found over 50 distant supernovae whose light was weaker than expected. The dimmer its light, the farther away the star. They just wanted to locate distant stars and to measure how they move. They expected to find signs that the expansion of the Universe was slowing down. What they found was the opposite: the galaxies were rushing away from us and each other, and the farther away they were, the faster they moved. This was a sign that the expansion of the Universe was accelerating. </p> </li> <li> <p>Today, the cosmological constant instead appears to make the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. This increase in the expansion speed could be caused by the push produced by the dark energy that covers the entire universe by an estimated 70%.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"vol-IV/vol-IV-chap-17-sect-2/#description-of-the-2011-physics-nobel-prize-awarded-to-perlmutter-schmidt-and-riess","title":"Description of the 2011 Physics Nobel Prize awarded to Perlmutter, Schmidt, and Riess.","text":"<p>WORK: \u201cThe universe\u2019s stars and galaxies are moving away from one another; the universe is expanding.

Three steps characterize the evolution of cosmology:</p> <p>(1) According to astrology and the development of prescientific astronomy by eye, it was believed that the positions of planets, stars and constellations defined the destiny of human beings. However, careful maps of their positions served as useful guides for navigation. According to this approach, the universe was a stationary and eternal scenario explained in terms of mysterious agents and miraculous circumstances.</p> <p>(2) Optical telescopes enlarged and deepened what could be seen with the naked eye because what was observed, measured, and described was communicated and interpretated in scientific terms. Then, the universe was conceived as a complicated scenario dynamically active and composed of many celestial objects among which the planet Earth was not central. This was a critical shift from philosophical speculations towards scientific explanations.</p> <p>(3) What now is called physical cosmology deals with the study and use of the emission, transport, and reception of signals different from visible light, like those produced by neutrinos or by gravitational waves.</p> <p>Three elements characterize contextualization of learning: the proposition of a problematic situation, the elaboration of generating questions which address the main issues of the theme to be contextualized, and the description of learning and evaluation activities to answer those questions. In what follows we apply this contextualization of learning procedure to analyze the content of Peebles\u00b4 Nobel Lecture.</p> <p>Firstly, we indicate that the problematic situation consists in the explanation of what cosmological knowledge is according to Peebles\u00b4 Nobel Lecture. Then we consider the following generating questions (GC): </p> <p> </p> <p>The third component of contextualization of learning consists in a set of answers (Ans) for each one of the previous questions.

Role of Robert Dicke.</p> <ul> <li>Doctoral dissertation under the advice of Dicke [Prg01].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cI began studying the large-scale nature of the universe in 1964, on the advice of Professor Robert Henry Dicke at Princeton University. Bob guided my doctoral dissertation and from then on, I counted on him as my professor of continuing education.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Integration into the Gravity Research Group [Prg04].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cIn 1964 Bob Dicke explained to three junior members of his Gravity Research Group, Peter Roll, David Wilkinson, and me, why he thought the universe might have expanded from a hot dense early condition\u201d. \u2026\u201d Bob suggested that Peter and David build a microwave radiometer that would detect the radiation, if it\u2019s there, and he suggested that I think about the theoretical implications of the result.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Dicke directed the search for the radiation [Prg07].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cBell Laboratories showed us in Princeton credible evidence that we are in a sea of microwave radiation, and that the radiation is close to uniform because the excess noise is close to the same wherever in the sky the antenna points. It proves to be what Dicke had suggested we look for, a fossil from the hot early stages of expansion of the universe.\u201d \u2026 \u201cWhy did the Nobel committee not name Dicke with Penzias and Wilson for the identification of this radiation?\u201d \u2026 \u201cBob directed the search for the radiation that explains the Bell Labs anomaly that so puzzled Penzias and Wilson.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Dicke suggests to Peebles thinking about the existence of the microwave radiation [Prg08].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cAt Bob Dicke\u2019s suggestion I had been thinking about the significance of finding or not finding a sea of radiation. A negative result, a tight upper bound on the radiation temperature, would have suggested an interesting problem. \u2026. So, I proposed a way out: postulate a sea of neutrinos with degeneracy energy large enough to have prevented electrons from combining with protons.\u201d \u2026</p> <ul> <li>The Nobel Prize Committee did not recognize Dicke\u2019s contributions [Prg41].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cI confess to having been unhappy with the Nobel Prize Committee for not recognizing Bob Dicke\u2019s deep influence in the development of gravity physics and cosmology. The committee had their reasons, of course; their considerations can be complicated. But I am satisfied now because my Nobel Prize is closure of what Bob set in motion, his great goal of establishing an empirically based gravity physics, by the establishment of the empirically based relativistic cosmology.\u201d</p> <p>Ans1.2. Opinions on cosmology and science.</p> <ul> <li>Cosmology as an extension of the reach of well-tested physical science [Prg39].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe establishment of cosmology is a considerable extension of the reach of well-tested physical science, and the story is simple enough that it offers a good illustration of the ways of physical science. \u2026. And I picture the broad general advance of physical science as a spreading wave that touches many and might be expected to trigger any particular idea more than once, apparently independently.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The established social constructions of science and Lambda cold dark matter [Prg40].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cMeanwhile, let us not forget the great lesson that the established social constructions of science are buttressed by rich and deep webs of evidence. Surely there is a better more complete cosmology than \u039bCDM. But we may be confident that the better theory will predict a universe that is a lot like \u039bCDM, with something analogous to its cosmological constant and dark matter, because the universe has been examined from many sides now and found to look a lot like \u039bCDM.\u201d</p> <p>NOTE: \u039bCDM means Lambda cold dark matter.</p> <p>Ans1.3. Publication of Peebles\u00b4 books.</p> <ul> <li>First book: Physical Cosmology [Prg35].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cI have written four books on the state of research in cosmology. I meant the title of the first, Physical Cosmology, to indicate that I did not intend to get into the subtleties of what might be termed astronomical cosmology: evidence from stellar evolution ages and the extragalactic distance scale.\u201d \u2026 \u201cAt about the time of publication, in Peebles (1971), Steve Weinberg (1972) published his book, Gravitation and Cosmology. It is more complete in the mathematical considerations. Mine is more complete in the considerations of phenomenology and of how the phenomenology might be related to physical processes.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Second book: The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe [Prg36].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cMy second book on cosmology, The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe, published in 1980, is a sort of catalog of the statistical measures I had devised and applied, the methods of analyses of how these measures might be expected to have evolved in an expanding universe, and the observational consequences of the evolution.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI meant this book to be a working guide to how we might proceed in research in physical cosmology.\u201d \u2026\u201d Writing this book helped me introduce what came to be known as the Cold Dark Matter cosmological model, in 1982.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Third book: Principles of Physical Cosmology [Prg37].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cMy third book, Principles of Physical Cosmology, is much larger than the second, which in turn is much larger than the first. This one was published in 1993, at about the end of the time when it was practical to aim to present in one volume a reasonably complete assessment of the state of research in the physical science of cosmology\u2026. Research in cosmology in the mid-1990s was an active turmoil of multiple ideas and promising-looking but confusing results from model fits to measurements in progress. That situation quite abruptly changed at the end of the decade, when research converged on a well-tested standard model, the \u039bCDM cosmology.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Fourth book: Cosmology\u00b4s Century [Prg02].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe usual thinking at the time was that the universe is homogeneous in the large-scale average, and that it is expanding and evolving as predicted by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. The schematic nature of this cosmology, and its scant observational support, worried me. But I saw a few interesting things to look into, the results suggested more, and that continued through my career. I review my story at length in the book Cosmology\u2019s Century (Peebles 2020). Here I recall a few of the steps along the path to the present standard and accepted cosmology that is so much better established than what I encountered in the early 1960s.\u201d</p> <p>GQ2: What is the cosmic microwave background radiation?</p> <p>Ans2.1. Discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation.</p> <ul> <li>What does it prove the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB)? [Prg03].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cCosmology became more interesting with the discovery that the universe is filled with a near uniform sea of microwave radiation with a thermal spectrum at a temperature of a few degrees Kelvin. This CMB (for cosmic microwave background radiation) proves to be a remnant from the hot early stages of expansion of the universe. Theory and observations in this great advance converged in a complicated way.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Experiments showing a departure from exact isotropy in the microwave radiation [Prg05].</li> </ul> <p>Description of a photography of a radiometer used to obtain a map of the variations of the radiation intensity across the sky, as an attempt to identify the presence of the sea of microwave radiation.</p> <ul> <li>Detection of CMB radiation in 1950 and initial investigations at Bell Labs until 1964 [Prg06].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe evidence I know is that the sea of microwave radiation was first detected in the late 1950s as unexpected excess noise in experiments in microwave communication at the Bell Telephone Laboratories.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe unexplained excess consistently appeared in later experiments. It remained a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d at Bell Labs until 1964, when Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, both new to the Bell Radio Research Laboratory at Crawford Hill, New Jersey, resolved to look into the problem. They carefully searched for the explanation of this puzzling excess microwave noise, whether originating in the instrument or somehow entering from the surroundings.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Independent consideration of the same problem at the same time [Prg08].</li> </ul> <p>\u2026 \u201cSo, I proposed a way out: postulate a sea of neutrinos with degeneracy energy large enough to have prevented electrons from combining with protons. In the Soviet Union Yakov Zel\u2019dovich saw the same problem with a cold big bang and he offered the same solution, lepton degeneracy. \u2026 The interesting thing is that we saw the problem at essentially the same time, independently.</p> <ul> <li>Recognition that the early universe had a rapid expansion and cooling [Prg09].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cI saw that a universe hot enough to have left a detectable sea of thermal radiation would have tended to leave the abundances of the elements in a mix characteristic of the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe. In an unpublished preprint in late 1964, I estimated that a reasonable upper bound on the primeval helium abundance requires a lower bound on the CMB temperature, \\(T_0 \u2265 10 K\\), in the absence of degeneracy.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Calculation of a lower bound on the CMB temperature \\(T_0\\) [Prg10].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cWe might pause to review why I had a lower bound on \\(T_0\\). During the course of expansion of the early universe, when the temperature fell through the critical value \\(T_c \u2265 10^9 K\\), detailed balance would have switched from suppression of deuterons by photodissociation to accumulation by radiative capture.\u201d \u2026 \u201dSo, my 1964 bound on the CMB temperature is a factor of three high. I have not attempted to discover why.\u201d</p> <p>Ans2.2. Calculations of a fossil radiation from a hot big bang theory.</p> <ul> <li>Theory of a hot big bang by Gamow [Prg11].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cAfter I had worked out these considerations, I learned that George Gamow already presented the physics of element buildup in a hot big bang in two memorable papers published in 1948 (Gamow 1948a, b). Gamow had earlier proposed that the chemical elements were produced in the hot early stages of expansion of the universe by successive neutron captures, beta decays keeping the atomic nuclei in the valley of stability.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Abundances of elements coming out of a hot big bang [Prg12].</li> </ul> <p>\u2026 \u201cBut Fermi and Terkevich at the University of Chicago soon worked the first computation of the buildup of element abundances in a hot big bang using realistic nuclear reaction rates. They established that there would be little element buildup beyond helium, a result of Alpher\u2019s mass-5 gap.\u201d \u2026 Soon after that we realized there is a sea of microwave radiation, and after that I published a better computation in Peebles (1966).\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Calculations in the Soviet Union [Prg13].</li> </ul> <p>\u201c\u2026 Zel\u2019dovich knew Gamow\u2019s ideas but thought they must be wrong because the theory predicts an unacceptably large primeval helium abundance. To check the prediction, he asked Yuri Smirnov (1964) to compute element production in the hot big bang model, along the same lines I was taking in the USA.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Calculations in the UK [Prg14].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cIn the UK, Hoyle and Tayler (1964) knew the evidence that the helium abundance in old stars is large, and not inconsistent with Gamow\u2019s (1948a, b) ideas.\u201d \u2026 \u201cTayler (1990) recalls that in 1964 he and Hoyle realized that Gamow\u2019s theory predicts the presence of a sea of thermal radiation, a fossil from the early hot conditions, but they supposed it would be obscured by all the radiation produced since then.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Description of the situation in 1964 [Prg15].</li> </ul> <p>\u2026 \u201cIn the USSR, Zel\u2019dovich thought Gamow\u2019s hot big bang theory is wrong because it overpredicts the helium abundance. In the UK, Hoyle knew the evidence that the prestellar helium abundance is large, and maybe consistent with Gamow\u2019s theory. But Hoyle expected the fossil radiation that would accompany it would be uninterestingly small. In the USA, I did not know about Gamow yet, but I knew there was a chance of detecting fossil radiation from a hot big bang that made helium because the foreground at microwave frequencies looked likely to be small. Also, in the USA, 30 miles from Princeton, Penzias and Wilson had a clear case of detection of microwave radiation of unknown origin.\u201d</p> <p>Ans2.3. On the space distribution of galaxies.</p> <ul> <li>Observations of the distributions of matter and radiation [Prg16].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cYet another multiple was the recognition of the role of the sea of thermal radiation in the gravitational growth of the galaxies, independently by Gamow, Zel\u2019dovich and his group, and me. I hit on what might be a singleton, the analysis of the effect of the dynamical interaction of matter and radiation in a hot big bang cosmology (in Peebles 1965 and many later papers).\u201d\u2026 \u201cThe termination of acoustic oscillations is a boundary condition that favors discrete wavelengths. That imprints distinctive patterns on the distributions of matter and radiation. The effects became known as BAO, for baryon acoustic oscillations.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI developed the basic ideas of the modern approach to the growth of cosmic structure that describes the radiation by its distribution in phase space.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The distributions of matter and radiation and the BAO theory [Prg17].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cIt took some time to connect BAO theory to observations of the effect in the distributions of matter and radiation. The BAO effect in the angular distribution of the CMB was discovered and well measured at the turn of the century, and at the time there was a hint of detection in the galaxy space distribution (as reviewed in Peebles 2020).\u201d \u2026. \u201cAnyway, I consider the connection of theory and observation of the effect of BAO to be a multiple.\u201d</p> <p>NOTE: CMB means Cosmic Microwave Background.</p> <ul> <li>Possible departure from the equilibrium condition in the CMB [Prg18].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cFor most of the time between BAO theory and observation it was not at all clear to me that there would be a detection. The BAO theory assumes standard physics, including the general theory of relativity. That is an extrapolation from the tests in the solar system and smaller, on scales \\(\u2265 10^{13} cm\\), to the scales of cosmology \\(\u2265 10^{28} cm\\).\u201d \u2026.. \u201cThe theory also assumes cosmic structure grew out of departures from homogeneity associated with small near scale-invariant spacetime curvature fluctuations.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThat might mean violent events in the early universe released a lot of energy, contributing some of it to the CMB and some to rearranging the matter. Or maybe the universe is not very close to homogeneous; maybe we observe a mix of radiation temperatures from different regions.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Experiments establishing that the CMB spectrum is very close to thermal [Prg19].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThis uncertain situation was resolved in 1990 by two brilliant experiments, one carried by the USA NASA satellite COBE, the other by the Canadian University of British Columbia rocket COBRA. Both established that the spectrum is very close to thermal.\u201d</p> <p>NOTE: COBE means Cosmic Background Explorer and COBRA Co-optimized Booster for Reusable Applications.</p> <ul> <li>Statistical measures of the galaxy distribution and motions [Prg20].</li> </ul> <p>\u2026 \u201cso while awaiting clarification of the spectrum measurements I turned to another program, statistical measures of the galaxy distribution and motions relative to the mean homogeneous expansion of the universe. There were several catalogs of galaxy positions ready and waiting for analyses.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThey counted galaxies in small cells in the sky, logging some one million galaxies by scanning photographic plates with a traveling microscope. This heroic effort took them ten years. Converting to data suitable for computation of statistical measures was a considerable effort too.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Results concerning the space distribution of galaxies [Prg21].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cSince I like images, I was pleased with the map we made of the largescale galaxy distribution.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Determination of galaxy position correlation functions [Prg22].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe Lick and other catalogs are compilations of galaxy angular positions with approximate distances. The statistical measures I used are N-point position correlation functions and their Fourier or spherical harmonic transforms.\u201d \u2026 \u201cIt showed that we had reliable measurements of the low order galaxy position correlation functions at separations from a few tens of kiloparsecs to a few megaparsecs.\u201d</p> <p>NOTE: parsec means parallax of one arc second. It is an astronomical unit measuring distances: 1 parsec = 3,2616 light years = 3,0857 \\(\\times 10^{16}\\) (30 856 804 799 935 500 meters).</p> <ul> <li>Methods and results of the calculation program [Prg23].</li> </ul> <p>\u2026 \u201cAnd I had the vague feeling that the results might offer a hint to how the galaxies and their clumpy space distribution got to be the way they are.\u201d \u2026.</p> <ul> <li>Existence of nonbaryonic matter in the empirically based cosmology [Prg24].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cBy 1980 it had become clear that the sea of microwave radiation is far smoother than the space distribution of the galaxies. But the mass concentrations in galaxies and groups and clusters of galaxies were supposed to have grown by gravity out of the initially close to homogeneous early universe of the hot big bang theory. How could this growth of mass concentrations have so little disturbed the CMB?\u201d \u2026. \u201cSuppose the baryonic matter that stars and planets and people are made of is only a trace element, and that most matter is dark and interacts weakly if at all with radiation and our type of baryonic matter.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe CMB would slip freely through this nonbaryonic dark matter, allowing mass concentrations to grow while disturbing the CMB only by the weak effect of gravity and by the interaction with a modest amount of our baryonic matter.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI also knew the relativistic prediction of the gravitational disturbance to the radiation produced by the departure from a homogeneous mass distribution.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Variation in the temperature caused by the observed matter distribution. [Prg25].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe model I put together from these pieces predicts that the disturbance to the CMB caused by the formation of the observed matter distribution would cause the CMB temperature to vary across the sky by a few parts per million. That is much less than the upper bounds from the CMB anisotropy measurements we had when I published this prediction in Peebles (1982). The CMB anisotropy was detected some 15 years later and found to agree with my computation within the modest uncertainties.\u201d</p> <p>GQ3: What is dark matter?</p> <p>Ans3.1. On cold dark matter.</p> <ul> <li>Proposition of a new form of matter to be called cold dark matter [Prg26].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe new form of matter in my 1982 proposal became known cold dark matter, or CDM, the \u201ccold\u201d meaning the dark matter pressure in the early universes was small enough not to have excessively smoothed the primeval mass distribution. I added the assumption that general relativity survives the immense extrapolation to the scales of cosmology, and that mass concentrations grew out of primeval spacetime curvature fluctuations.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) as a new class of neutrinos [Prg27].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThere was a remarkable multiple in 1977. Five groups, independently as far as I can tell, introduced the idea of a new class of neutrinos with rest mass ~ 3 GeV. They became known as WIMPs, for weakly interacting massive particles.\u201d \u2026.. \u201cYet the WIMP idea appeared not long after the astronomers had good evidence of subluminal mass around galaxies, and not long before I needed nonbaryonic cold dark matter to account for the smoothness of the CMB.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Simplicity of the cold dark matter cosmology (CDM) [Prg28].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cIn particular, my 1982 paper assumed for simplicity that the universe is expanding at escape velocity, but by that time I already knew what I considered to be reasonably good evidence that the expansion is faster than that.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Analyses of data related to the measurements of galaxy redshifts [Prg29].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cExpansion at escape velocity, in the relativistic Einstein-de Sitter cosmological model that assumes space curvature and Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant may be ignored, would mean that whenever we happened to flourish and take an interest in the expanding universe, we would find that the rate of expansion is at escape velocity.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe results in Davis and Peebles (1983) surprised me by suggesting that we do flourish at a special epoch.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Determination of the mean mass density in the formation of galaxies [Prg30].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThese redshift data yielded a probe of the relative motions of the galaxies. That gave a measure of galaxy masses, which indicated that the mean mass density is less than required for escape velocity.\u201d \u2026 \"Davis and I found consistent galaxy mass estimates from the relative motions of galaxies over a range of a factor of ten in separation.\u201d \u2026. \u201cBut if galaxy formation were suppressed in low density regions then galaxies that did manage to form there ought to show signs of a deprived youth: irregulars or dwarfs.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Expansion of the universe faster than escape velocity [Prg31].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cFrom the early 1980s through the mid-1990s I played the role of Cassandra, emphasizing the growing evidence that the universe is expanding faster than escape velocity to people who for the most part would rather not think about it.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe evidence was reasonably good then, and it is well established now, that we flourish at a special time in the course of evolution of the universe, as the rate of expansion is becoming significantly more rapid than escape.\u201d</p> <p>NOTE: according to Greek mythology, Cassandra was a priestess who suffered the malediction that nobody will belief on her predictions.</p> <p>Ans3.2. The \u039bCDM cosmology as a well-tested standard model.</p> <ul> <li>Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant \u039b in the \u039bCDM theory [Prg32].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cIn 1984 I introduced the accommodation to the low mass density that proves to work: add Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant, \u039b (Peebles 1984), in what became known as the \u039bCDM theory.\u201d \u2026 \u201cEinstein wrote his constant as \u03bb. I don\u2019t know who introduced the change to \u039b. I believe Michael Turner, the University of Chicago, introduced the change of name to dark energy.\u201d \u2026 \u201cAnyway, I think I was the first to present actual computations of the effect of adding \u039b.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Measurements of CMB anisotropy confirmed characteristic of the \u039bCDM theory [Prg33].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cIn the years around the mid-1990s I again acted in my self-appointed role of Cassandra, because I was not at all confident that the \u039bCDM theory is a good approximation. The tests were not yet all that tight, and I could think of other models that fit the data about as well. In the late 1990s I was finishing my latest and maybe most elegant alternative to \u039bCDM when I learned that the CMB anisotropy measurements revealed features characteristic of the theory Jer Ju and I had worked out a quarter century earlier.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The \u039bCDM theory passes demanding tests [Prg34].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cI remain surprised and impressed at how well \u039bCDM passes ever more demanding tests. But I continue to hope that challenges to \u039bCDM will be found and help guide us to a still better more complete theory.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Observational programs converging on a well-tested standard model [Prg38].</li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe convergence was driven by three great observational programs. One is the tight measurement of the redshift-magnitude relation that reveals the departure from the linear low redshift limit.\u201d \u2026 \u201cSecond is the precision measurement of the cosmic microwave radiation anisotropy spectrum. \u201c \u2026 \u201cThe third, the measurement of the cosmic mean mass density, was the main focus of empirical research in cosmology from the early 1980s through the mid1990s.\u201d \u2026. \u201cThe three made the case for a cosmology that is hard to resist. I have once again given in to the impulse to write a book.\u201d</p> <p>NOTE: Peebles refers to his fourth book Cosmology\u2019s Century published in 2020.</p>"},{"location":"vol-IV/vol-IV-chap-17-sect-3/#references","title":"REFERENCES","text":"<p>MLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Selection of Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.","text":"<p>Sciences are rational systems for explaining certain objects and phenomena. Sciences are not dry knowledge; they are embedded in social contexts. Natural sciences and social sciences look for describing and understanding structural properties and functional behaviors of diverse universes. They have distinct levels and degrees of development because they address different kinds of problems; they create, apply, and test their own concepts, models, and research methodologies. The universes of humans and societies are different from the universes of atoms, molecules, galaxies, and black holes.</p> <p>Alfred Nobel signed his will on November 27, 1895, and he died on December 10, 1896. It was till December 10, 1901, that the first Nobel Prizes were awarded in Physics, Chemistry, and Physiology or Medicine, as well as in Literature and Peace. N0 place for Mathematics neither for Social Sciences. Nevertheless, in 1968, the Sveriges Riksbank established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Understanding recognized research works in Economic Sciences compensate the original decision made by Alfred Nobel.</p> <p>Economic Sciences is a branch of social sciences where societies and human relationships are studied. There are two main methods for approaching social sciences: the positivist one and the interpretative or speculative one. These methods apply the following research design types to different kind of objects of study: the quantitative design looks for quantitative evidence, apply statistical analysis and create valid and reliable general claims, and the qualitative design is based on direct observation and communication with participants, and tries to achieve contextual and subjective accuracy over generality.</p> <p>Economy has been historically developed through three main phases or degrees: in ancient times, it was based on subsistence farming; then, because of the industrial revolution, it was mostly dependent on mining, construction and manufacturing industries, as well as in commerce; and in modern times, where consumer societies have been characterized by technological developments and commercial arrangements.</p> <p>Usually, Economy is divided into Microeconomics (the study of the behavior of the individual consumers and businesses that make up the economy) and Macroeconomics (the study of the overall performance of an economy). Microeconomics deals with its basic elements like economic agents (individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments), firms and markets, and operations like production, exchange, and consumption. Macroeconomics refers to  the structure, performance, behavior, and decision-making of the whole system in connection with phenomena such as inflation, price levels, rate of economic growth, national income, gross domestic product, inflation, balance of trade, changes in unemployment, \u2026.</p> <p>To have an idea of how broad the discipline of Economic Sciences is we consider the classification of publication categories in the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL), according to the American Economic Association (AEA). The following list has been obtained from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEL_classification_codes.</p> <ul> <li>General Economics and Teaching</li> <li>History of Economic Thought</li> <li>Economic methodology and Heterodox Approaches</li> <li>Mathematical and Quantitative Methods</li> <li>Microeconomics</li> <li>Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics</li> <li>International Economics</li> <li>Financial Economics, Public Economics</li> <li>Health, Education, and Welfare</li> <li>Labor Economics and Demographic Economics</li> <li>Law and Economics</li> <li>Business Administration and Business Economics</li> <li>Marketing, Accounting, Personnel Economics</li> <li>Economic History</li> <li>Economic Development, Innovation, Technological Change and Growth</li> <li>Economic Systems</li> <li>Agriculture and Natural Resource Economics</li> <li>Environmental and Ecological Economics</li> <li>Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics</li> <li>Miscellaneous Categories</li> <li>Industrial Organization</li> </ul> <p>Up to now, 54 Prizes in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel have been awarded in the period 1969-2023. In this Chapter 15 we select 15 of those Prizes mostly associated to econometry and economic theories connected with one of the following five aspects: decisions, games, welfare, development, and natural experiments. Each item in the list contains the year of the award, the names and dates of the laureates, and the reasons for such recognitions.

Scientific analysis along these lines is used to explain such complicated economic processes as economic growth, cyclical fluctuations, and reallocations of economic resources for different purposes.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.. </p> <p>\u201cTo the layman, it may seem somewhat reckless to seek, without support from experiment, for laws of development within these extremely complicated processes of economic change, and to apply for this purpose the techniques of mathematical and statistical analysis. However, the attempts of economists to construct mathematical models relating to strategic economic relations, and then to specify these quantitatively with the help of statistical analysis of time series, have, in fact, proved successful. It is precisely this line of economic research, mathematical economics, and econometrics, that has characterized the development of this discipline in recent decades.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cProfessor Frisch and Professor Tinbergen have been working along essentially the same lines. Their aim has been to lend economic theory mathematical stringency, and to render it in a form that permits empirical quantification and a statistical testing of hypotheses. One essential object has been to get away from the vague, more \u201cliterary\u201d type of economics. The arbitrary \u201cnaming\u201d of causes of cyclical fluctuations, for instance, and the concentration upon certain simple chains of causal connection, has given way, in the work of both Frisch and Tinbergen, to mathematical systems that state the mutual relationships between economic variables.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me take, as an example, Professor Frisch\u2019s pioneer work in the early thirties involving a dynamic formulation of the theory of cycles. He demonstrated how a dynamic system with difference and differential equations for investments and consumption expenditure, with certain monetary restrictions, produced a damped wave movement with wavelengths of 4 and 8 years. By exposing the system to random disruptions, he could demonstrate also how these wave movements became permanent and uneven in a rather realistic manner. Frisch was before his time in the building of mathematical models, and he has many successors. The same is true of his contribution to methods for the statistical testing of hypotheses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProfessor Tinbergen was concerned primarily to confront dynamic economic theory with statistical application. His great pioneer work in this field is an econometric study of cyclical fluctuations in the United States. An important aim in this impressive investigation was to test the explanatory value of the existing flora of business cycle theories by trying to specify, quantitatively, the importance of different factors. Tinbergen built up an econometric system involving some 50 equations and determined reaction coefficients and \u201cleads and lags\u201d with the help of statistical analysis. Several of his conclusions excited great attention and are still the subject of debate. Professor Tinbergen\u2019s pioneer work in econometrics has been of major importance for subsequent methodological development.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cDuring the past ten years, both Professor Frisch and Professor Tinbergen have devoted themselves primarily to long-term economic policy and planning, with a view particularly to the problems of the developing countries. Both have served as advisers in different contexts. In the rapid development of methods for long-term planning, our two laureates have made major contributions. Professor Tinbergen, for instance, with regard to systems of priorities in investments, and the use of \u201cshadow prices\u201d. Professor Frisch has developed decision models for economic planning, devising mathematical programming methods with a view to exploiting modern computer techniques.\u201d</p> <p>PRIZE LECTURE: From Utopian Theory to Practical Applications: The Case of Econometrics by Ragnar Frisch.</p> <p>MLA style: Ragnar Frisch \u2013 Prize Lecture.

Sat. 3 Aug 2024. https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1969/frisch/lecture/</p> <p>INTRODUCTION. </p> <p>\u201cIn this essay on econometrics in its conception and its use in economic planning for the betterment of man\u2019s fate, I will try to cover a very broad field.\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>1.    THE LURES OF UNSOLVABLE PROBLEMS.</p> <p>\u201cDeep in the human nature there is an almost irresistible tendency to concentrate physical and mental energy on attempts at solving problems that seem to be unsolvable.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>Description of the following problems: The mountain climber, The Alchemists, The alluring symmetry problem in particle physics, The population explosion in the world of elementary particles, Matter and antimatter, Travelling at a speed superior to that of light, The dream of Stanley Jevons (The English mathematician and economist Stanley Jevons (1835-1882) dreamed of the day when we would be able to quantify at least some of the laws and regularities of economics, and Struggle, sweat and tears.</p> <p>2.    A PHILOSOPHY OF CHAOS. THE EVOLUTION TOWARDS A MAMMOTH SINGULAR TRANSFORMATION.</p> <p>Definition of Philosophy in The Concise Oxford Dictionary: \u201clove of wisdom or knowledge, especially that which deals with ultimate reality, or with the most general causes and principles of things\u201d. </p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, science too has a constant craving for regularities. Science considers it a triumph whenever it has been able by some partial transformation here or there, to discover new and stronger regularities.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThis search for regularities may well be thought of as the essence of what we traditionally mean by the word \u201cunderstanding\u201d. This \u201cunderstanding\u201dis one aspect of man\u2019s activity. Another - and equally important - is a vision of the purpose of the understanding.\u201d </p> <p>3.    A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMICS IN THE LAST CENTURY.</p> <p>\u201cIn the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) in his famous work \u201cPrinciples of Economics\u201dsaid that so far as general principles are concerned the theory of value and price was now completely elaborated.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cThe economic process is an equilibrium affair where both technological and subjective forces are at play. The subjective element was nearly left out by the classicists.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026. \u201cPartly under the influence of the criticism of the historical school and the institutionalists the theoreticians themselves took up a systematic work of building up the theory in such a way that the theory could be brought in immediate contact with the observational material. One might say that from now on economics moved into that stage where the natural sciences had been for a long time, namely the stage where theory derives its concepts from the observational technique, and in turn theory influences the observational technique.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the first time in history it now seemed that the work on the theoretical front in economics - now to a large extent mathematically formulated - and the work on the outer descriptive front should converge and support each other, giving us a theory that was elaborate enough to retain the concrete observational material, and at the same time a mass of observations that were planned and executed with a view to be filled into the theoretical structure.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as economic theory still works on a purely qualitative basis without attempting to measure the numerical importance of the various factors, practically any \u201cconclusion\u201dcan be drawn and defended.\u201d</p> <p>4.    SOME HISTORICAL NOTES ON THE FOUNDING OF THE ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY.</p> <p>Reference to letters dating from the years when the plans for the creation of an econometric society took shape\u2026. The creation of the journal \u201cEconometrica\u201d as well as an international cercle of mathematical economist were also considered.</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>The beginning of the abstract of a meeting organized at Harvard University on 29 February 1928 reads as follows: </p> <p>\u201cI. The terms econometric and econometrics are interpreted as including both pure economics and the statistical verification of the laws of pure economics, in essential distinction to the purely empirical manipulation of statistical data on economic phenomena. </p> <p>II. The possibility of establishing a systematic annotated bibliography of econometric literature was discussed.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>The Econometric Society was formed in Cleveland, Ohio on 29 December 1930.</p> <p>5.    TYPES OF ECONOMETRIC MODELS AS SEEN FROM AN ADVANCED VIEWPOINT TODAY.</p> <p>\u201cIn connection with the Second World Congress of The Econometric Society to be held in Cambridge, England 7-14 September 1970, Frisch gives a survey of types of econometric models at the national level and an example of how one selected problem may be handled.</p> <p>Some general remarks on types of econometric models at the national level.</p> <p>\u201cThe list of variables and the equations and/or bounds that are introduced, constitute the core of the model. It may be linear or non-linear.\u201d</p> <p>The preference function.</p> <p>\u2026 \u201cA preference function is a function whose maximization defines the goal of the decisions that might be studied through the model.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u201cThe interview approach to the preference function is only a first stage in an iterative process which in each step proceeds by an optimal solution of the model.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u2026. \u201cThus the preference function as it appears in our models is an expression for the preferences of the decision making authority, whatever this authority may be. The preference function in the model must not be confounded with a general \u201cWelfare function\u201d in the sense of welfare theory.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cIt is not the task for us as econometricians and social engineers to go into a detailed discussion of the political system. Somewhere in the hierarchy of sciences a line of demarcation has to be drawn. And here is where we find the line of demarcation for the econometric planner.\u201d</p> <p>6.    THE TRANSITION TOWARDS ECONOMIC PLANNING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL.</p> <p>\u201cAny econometrician who wants to see practical application of his science, will be highly concerned with applications to economic planning at the national level.\u201d</p> <p>Economic planning the basis for efficiency and a living democracy. </p> <p>\u2026. \u201cThe problem I am driving at is more ambitious than just to increase the long-term average growth rate of gross national product. My purpose is to make economic planning at a high aspiration level one of the pillars of a living democracy.\u201d </p> <p>A high aspiration level.</p> <p>\u2026.. \u201cAnd we are hopeful that we will one day come at least very much closer to the precision of the physicists, than we are today. It is comforting to know that already politicians in many countries do find our work useful.\u201d</p> <p>The cooperation between the politicians and the experts.</p> <p>\u201cAlready today there is, of course, a good deal of cooperation between politicians and experts. But on one point there is need for a new break-through, namely in making it a practice to cooperate on the formalization of the preference function. This will be of basic importance for clarifying what the political authorities really are aiming at. </p> <p>For simplicity let me first describe how to attack the problem for a given political party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA preparatory phase of the expert\u2019s work would simply consist in his making a systematic use of his general knowledge of the political atmosphere in the country, and in particular the political atmosphere in the party in question.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u201cIn a subsequent phase the expert - on the basis of his tentative formalization- will work out a system of interview questions through which he will get closer to the formalization of the preferences in question.\u201d </p> <p>\u2026. </p> <p>\u201cIn the third phase the expert will go back to his electronic computer in which he had already entered the data regarding the core of the economy. To this he will now add the formalization of the preferences in the quantitative form as he now sees it. From this will come out a solution, in the form of an optimal development path for the economy. \u2026.. The expert will understand more or less precisely what sort of changes are needed in the formulation of the preference function in order to produce a solution that comes closer to what the politicians now say they want. This leads to a discussion back and forth.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026. </p> <p>\u201cWe should proceed to a discussion of what sort of political compromise that might be reached in the formulation of a unified system of preferences. And then having reached this compromise formulation, there would appear a compromise optimal solution. Here too an iteration between politicians and experts would take place.\u201d</p> <p>7.    INVESTMENT STARTING vs. INVESTMENT SINKING.</p> <p>\u201cI shall give an example illustrating an advanced approach to a point in the planning technique. It concerns the measurement of investments in an advanced planning model. If the planning model has a time horizon of more than, say, a year or two, and if investment decisions are an important part of the analyses, the distinction between investment starting and investment sinking (investment carry-on-activity) is essential.\u201d </p> <p>7.1.

NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2024. Sat. 3 Aug 2024. https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1969/tinbergen/lecture/</p> <p>1. Essence of models.</p> <p>\u201cIn this lecture I propose to discuss the experience we have had with the method of model building as a contribution to economic science and the prospects for its further application. First of all I want to remind you of the essential features of models. In my opinion they are: (i) drawing up a list of the variables to be considered; (ii) drawing up a list of the equations or relations the variables have to obey and (iii) testing the validity of the equations, which implies the estimation of their coefficients, if any. As a consequence of especially (iii) we may have to revise (i) and (ii) so as to arrive at a satisfactory degree of realism of the theory embodied in the model. Then, the model may be used for various purposes, that is, for the solution of various problems. The advantages of models are, on one hand, that they force us to present a \u201ccomplete\u201d theory by which I mean a theory taking into account all relevant phenomena and relations and, on the other hand, the confrontation with observation, that is, reality. Of course, these remarks are far from new.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile building models econometricians were often forced to supplement \u201cliterary\u201d theories, since these often did not specify all relationships they were implicitly using.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cModels have been built for a number of different purposes; first of all, for purposes of explaining actual developments and next, for finding ways of influencing actual development in some desired direction. Another aspect is whether short-term or long-term movements were the objective of either explanation or policies. There are large numbers of further alternatives of focusing. We will discuss some of them in this lecture.\u201d</p> <p>2. Some experiences.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, I am going to discuss a number of experiences econometricians had with the activity of model building. Some of us were masters in hunting after high correlations, that is, good fits with observed values. \u2026. I am afraid that the first subject I tackled in my work for the League of Nations, namely to explain the fluctuations in investment activity never has become a great success. In the Netherlands Central Planning Bureau we found it safer, after some years, to ask industrialists for their investment programs rather than rely on an econometric explanation. Also government expenditures were among the variables difficult to explain. In both cases we may account for the lack of success by the fact that a small number of decision makers determine the picture and that hence random deviations will be important.\u201d </p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u201cIn several parts of our science, and I presume in other sciences as well, we must beware of following vogues too easily. Model building has become a vogue, just as, after that, linear programming or matrix algebra have become. \u2026.  But a critical examination of the structure of the problem before we try to solve it remains useful. And let me add immediately that linear programming does constitute a very useful technique in many cases indeed.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u201cIn an attempt to evaluate what model building has contributed to the theory and practice of economic science I feel that at least we can say that models have had a didactic value. Often in our textbooks we bring simplified, not to say over-simplified, pictures of reality which nonetheless contribute to making understood some essential features of that reality.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>\u201cWhat I called \u201cdidactic value\u201d also stands for communication value. The ability of a planning expert to communicate with politicians and with citizens constitutes an important element in any type of democratic or semi-democratic planning and such communication can be enhanced by relatively simple models.\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>\u201cI do think, however, that the utility of models goes beyond their didactic value. They are a real and essential element in the preparation of well-coordinated policies. But they cannot do this job all by themselves. Models constitute a framework or a skeleton and the flesh and blood will have to be added by a lot of common sense and knowledge of details.\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>\u2026. </p> <p>\u201cA need generally felt by model builders and their critics is the need for refinement, that is, for the introduction of many more variables. In a way this experience again was a lesson also to economists in general, since often their arguments run in terms not showing this degree of detail.\u201d \u2026 </p> <p>\u2026 </p> <p>\u201cThe other additional example of the need for more refined models and information can be taken from the experiences of the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). The essential feature of this Institute\u2019s work is to include a number of so-called social variables. \u2026. Precise knowledge about interrelationships can be obtained only by the technique of quantitative models; but the lack of homogeneity of crude information is the reason for the lack of success in the social area and hence refinement of the base material is the real need here.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cAll these refinements will make for ever more complicated models and therefore threat to make models unmanageable. This once again underlines the need for several stages of decision-making and hence of planning. As already said, the need for communication with the people and groups involved also points into the direction of this step-wise use of models. So also does the organizational aspect of decision making; a correspondence between the organizational setup of an optimum socio-economic order and the levels or stages of planning and the use of models for it is desirable. One of the future features of such a setup will also be the more precise location of the flows of information and, more particularly, the type of information needed.\u201d</p> <p>3. Prospects of model building</p> <p>\u201cLet us now turn to the future of model building. The primitive state of the art has become clear from our preceding remarks. We have already indicated some of the directions in which models will have to be developed. Our present subject, the prospects of model building, of course overlaps with the subject discussed so far. As a consequence, some repetition cannot be avoided; but we will approach the subject from a somewhat different angle. Our central question will now be what extension should be given to the scope of model building. Some of the developments to be discussed have already been started.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA first subject to be dealt with refers to the necessity to introduce the element of space into socio-economic models.\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cWhile these various examples show the picture of lively activity in the field of the economics of space, it is clear that some fundamental features characteristic of the subject can hardly be included already into the methods used. On one hand, empirical data are lacking on such features as external effects and on the other hand mathematical techniques are lacking \u2013 or at least not known to my collaborators, let alone to myself \u2013 needed to generalize sufficiently the models developed as examples.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA second subject to deal with, in discussing the widening of the scope of economic models, is the inclusion of so-called social and political variables. \u2026.  With the increased awareness of the role of education in economic and social development and with the budget for education being among the largest budgets of the various ministries, the need for further work in this type of models can easily be understood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnother social subject is income distribution. \u2026.  Models of this kind may soon be used to study in a more precise way also the possibilities to change income distribution and, for example, to find out what degree of inequality is inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>\u201cA third example of the simultaneous introduction of many social and political variables into models, especially for developing countries, is the impressive attempt made by Irma Adelman and her collaborators using factor analysis and discriminant functions in order to discover, which of some thirty odd factors, measured in a heroic way, seem to play a preponderant part in the process of development.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>\u201cThe third subject to be discussed under the heading of widening the scope of models is the one off specifying optimum socio-economic orders. Optimization is not a new subject, of course. Mathematical programming models are now widely used, both on the level of the production unit and on higher levels. Scientific development took place along various tracks.\u201d</p> <p>..\u2026</p> <p>\u201cThere are two other tracks, however, which I want to sketch out. One is the discussion of the social welfare function, or the objective function. \u2026. The second other track I want to sketch out is to reformulate the problem of the socio-economic optimum.\u201d  \u2026..</p> <p>\u201cIt is also our hope that the interpretation of the socio-economic optimum as a set of institutions may help to get under way a discussion of a more scientific character than was usual so far about the relative merits of various existing socio-economic orders, especially those of Eastern and Western Europe, including such interesting cases as Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. A considerable amount of better information about various types of external effects will be one of the necessary ingredients if we want to give concrete content to such merit rating of various systems. It is my hope that in such a way we may again, as Marx claimed, find scientific arguments in the competition between various systems, but up-to-date scientific arguments rather than obsolete ones. This more fundamental research in economics deserves relatively more attention and resources than the more superficial versions of economic research directed at forecasting or analyzing very short-term fluctuations in market prices, on which quite some money is being spent to-day.\u201d</p> <p>Next: 15.3.

Their approach has spread to other fields and revolutionised empirical research.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany of the big questions in the social sciences deal with cause and effect. How does immigration affect pay and employment levels? How does a longer education affect someone\u2019s future income? These questions are difficult to answer because we have nothing to use as a comparison. We do not know what would have happened if there had been less immigration or if that person had not continued studying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHowever, this year\u2019s Laureates have shown that it is possible to answer these and similar questions using natural experiments. The key is to use situations in which chance events or policy changes result in groups of people being treated differently, in a way that resembles clinical trials in medicine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUsing natural experiments, David Card has analysed the labour market effects of minimum wages, immigration and education. His studies from the early 1990s challenged conventional wisdom, leading to new analyses and additional insights. The results showed, among other things, that increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs. We now know that the incomes of people who were born in a country can benefit from new immigration, while people who immigrated at an earlier time risk being negatively affected. We have also realised that resources in schools are far more important for students\u2019 future labour market success than was previously thought.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cData from a natural experiment are difficult to interpret, however. For example, extending compulsory education by a year for one group of students (but not another) will not affect everyone in that group in the same way. Some students would have kept studying anyway and, for them, the value of education is often not representative of the entire group. So, is it even possible to draw any conclusions about the effect of an extra year in school? In the mid-1990s, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens solved this methodological problem, demonstrating how precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCard\u2019s studies of core questions for society and Angrist and Imbens\u2019 methodological contributions have shown that natural experiments are a rich source of knowledge. Their research has substantially improved our ability to answer key causal questions, which has been of great benefit to society,\u201d says Peter Fredriksson, chair of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee.</p> <p>Popular information: Natural experiments help answer important questions.</p> <p>MLA style: Popular information.

However, answering broad questions about cause and effect is not easy, because we will never know what would have happened if we had made a different choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne way of establishing causality is to use randomised experiments, where researchers allocate individuals to treatment groups by a random draw. This method is used to investigate the efficacy of new medicines, among other things, but is not suitable for investigating many societal issues \u2013 for example, we cannot have a randomised experiment determining who gets to attend upper-secondary school and who does not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDespite these challenges, the Laureates have demonstrated that many of society\u2019s big questions can be answered. Their solution is to use natural experiments \u2013 situations arising in real life that resemble randomised experiments. These natural experiments may be due to natural random variations, institutional rules or policy changes. In pioneering work from the early 1990s, David Card analysed some central questions in labour economics \u2013 such as the effects of a minimum wage, immigration and education \u2013 using this approach.\u201d \u2026.</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cNatural experiments differ from clinical trials in one important way \u2013 in a clinical trial, the researcher has complete control over who is offered a treatment and eventually receives it (the treatment group) and who is not offered the treatment and therefore does not receive it (the control group). In a natural experiment, the researcher also has access to data from treatment and control groups but, unlike a clinical trial, the individuals may themselves have chosen whether they want to participate in the intervention being offered. This makes it much more difficult to interpret the results of a natural experiment. In an innovative study from 1994, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens showed what conclusions about causation can be drawn from natural experiments in which people cannot be forced to participate in the programme being studied (nor forbidden from doing so). The framework they created has radically changed how researchers approach empirical questions using data from natural experiments or randomised field experiments.\u201d</p> <p>One example of a natural experiment</p> <p>\u201cLet us use a concrete example to illustrate how a natural experiment works. One question that is relevant to both society and to young people considering their future, is how much more you would earn if you chose to study longer.\u201d \u2026..</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cIt would be easy to believe that situations which enable natural experiments are very unusual, especially those that can be used to answer important questions. \u2026.  There is thus unintended randomness that divides people into control and treatment groups, providing researchers with opportunities for uncovering causal relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Understanding labour markets</p> <p>The effects of a minimum wage</p> <p>\u201cIn the early 1990s, the conventional wisdom among economists was that higher minimum wages lead to lower employment because they increase wage costs for businesses. \u2026. Reverse causation could even be the issue: when unemployment rises, employers can set lower wages which, in turn, may lead to demands to increase the minimum wage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo investigate how increased minimum wages affect employment, Card and Krueger used a natural experiment. \u2026. As with randomised experiments, a control group was needed, i.e., a group where wages didn\u2019t change but all the other factors were the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026..</p> <p>\u201cCard and Krueger focused on employment in fast-food restaurants, an industry where pay is low and minimum wages matter. \u2026..  The overall conclusion is that the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage are small, and significantly smaller than was believed 30 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe work conducted by Card at the beginning of the 1990s also led to new research, which attempted to explain the absence of negative effects on employment. \u2026.. The many studies inspired by Card and Krueger\u2019s work have considerably improved our understanding of the labour market.\u201d</p> <p>Research on immigration and education</p> <p>\u201cAnother important issue is how the labour market is affected by immigration. To answer this question, we need to know what would have happened if there had not been any immigration.\u201d \u2026.. \u201cTo examine how this huge influx of workers affected the labour market in Miami, David Card compared the wage and employment trends in Miami with the evolution of wages and employment in four comparison cities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDespite the enormous increase in labour supply, Card found no negative effects for Miami residents with low levels of education. Wages did not fall and unemployment did not increase relative to the other cities. This study generated large amounts of new empirical work, and we now have a better understanding of the effects of immigration.\u201d\u2026..</p> <p>\u2026..  \u201cCard and Krueger found that resources are important: returns on education increased with teacher density in the state in which the individuals had grown up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis research also inspired many new studies. There is now relatively strong empirical support to show that investments in education influence students\u2019 later success on the labour market. This effect is particularly strong for students from disadvantaged backgrounds\u201d.</p> <p>A new framework for studies of causal relationships</p> <p>\u201cIn all realistic scenarios, the effect of an intervention \u2013 for example, the effect of additional schooling on earnings \u2013 varies between people. Moreover, individuals are affected differently by a natural experiment. \u2026. How can a causal relationship between education and income be established?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJoshua Angrist and Guido Imbens tackled this problem in an influential study from the mid-1990s. More specifically, they asked the following question: Under which conditions can we use a natural experiment to estimate the effects of a particular intervention, such as a computing course, when the effects vary between individuals and we do not have complete control of who participates? How can we estimate this effect and how should it be interpreted?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomewhat simplified, we can imagine a natural experiment as if it randomly divides individuals into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group is entitled to participate in a programme while the control group is not. Angrist and Imbens showed that it is possible to estimate the effect of the programme by applying a two-step process (known as the instrumental variables method). The first step investigates how the natural experiment affects the probability of programme participation. The second step then considers this probability when evaluating the effect of the actual programme. \u2026. Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens thus showed exactly what conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Their analysis is also relevant for randomised experiments where we do not have complete control over who participates in the intervention, which is the case in almost all field experiments. The framework developed by Angrist and Imbens has been widely adopted by researchers who work with observational data. By clarifying the assumptions necessary to establish a causal relationship, their framework has also increased the transparency \u2013 and thus credibility \u2013 of empirical research.\u201d</p> <p>A revolution in empirical research</p> <p>\u201cThe Laureates\u2019 contributions from the early 1990s demonstrate that it is possible to answer important questions about cause and effect using natural experiments. Their contributions complement and strengthen one another: Angrist and Imbens\u2019 methodological insights about natural experiments and Card\u2019s applications of this approach to important questions led the way for other researchers. We now have a coherent framework which, among other things, means that we know how the results of such studies should be interpreted. The work of the Laureates has revolutionised empirical research in the social sciences and significantly improved the ability of the research community to answer questions of great importance to us all.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vol-IV/vol-IV-chap-20-sect-3/#references","title":"REFERENCES","text":"<p>MLA style: Advanced information.

UNIVERSE","text":"<p>(Image credit: Leonardo AI)</p> <p>This is the fourth Volume of the series MODERN PHYSICS BY EXPLORING NOBEL PRIZES. It refers to understanding some aspects of the universe. According to Carl Sagan: \u201cthe universe is all that existed, exists and will exist\u201d. Understanding requires asking questions and proposing answers that foster the improvement of knowledge. It means to bite the unknown.</p> <p>The study of the universe is like archaeology in the sense that it concerns the reconstruction of what is past and like history because it consists in the interpretation of what has been registered. The traces of the past serve to interpret the present and propose radiographies of possible futures.</p> <p>Physics, as a natural science, deals with objects and forces acting in regions that existed since the beginning of time, as well as in regions observed nowadays in modern accelerators of particles. The ways of building and applying concepts, models and research methodologies have evolved in universes integrated by particles, waves, matter and energy. To study those universes mathematics serves as bridges for solving problems and ladders for attaining better and better explanations.</p> <p>In this Volume IV we review and comment the essential nodes of a cognitive network of explanations, discoveries, and inventions that have been recognized with Nobel Prizes, mostly in Physics and few in Chemistry. Chapters 16 (Development of knowledge in high energy physics) and 17 (Evolution of cosmology) deal with high energy physics which comprehends nuclear physics, particle physics and cosmology. These regions of the universe differ in the size of its components and the intensity of the energies involved. The Chapters of this fourth Volume are the following:</p> <p> </p> <p>Since the atoms were not considered as indivisible, the study of its nuclei became interesting and possible due to more advanced theoretical interpretations of matter and energy, as well as to the fact that the realization of experiments had the support of complex technological infrastructures and extensive systems of collaboration. First, physicists and chemists studied radioactivity and discovered that atoms contained protons, neutrons and electrons. Then they start understanding and even provoking nuclear reactions resulting in new elements, isotopes, particles, strange entities called quarks, and great amounts of energy.</p> <p>The existence of four types of forces was revealed: the gravitational force and the electromagnetic force already studied in classic physics, the weak force (responsible for the radioactive decay of atoms) and the strong force (responsible for the creation of atomic nuclei). The Standard Model of Particle Physics provided a uniform framework for understanding electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. Nevertheless, theoretical schemes of classification of particles have not been successful to include in satisfactory ways the gravitational force.</p> <p>Three levels of operation of the mechanisms of knowing are associated with contributions made by Nobel laureates: the laboratory instruments relates to the level intra for the description of objects, the experimental results relate to the level inter for the transformation of concepts, and the theoretical approaches relate to the level trans for the construction of structures.</p> <p> </p> <p>Aside from the human eyes, the first devices for observing bodies outside Earth were optic telescopes. Afterwards, different technologies changed the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation used to detect the positions and structure of planets, stars, moons, comets, galaxies, pulsars, and even black holes. As data obtained from farthest events correspond to the oldest ones to be registered, modern astronomical observatories are telling us what happened in the first moments of the universe. </p> <p>Complicated and longtime astronomical observations and measurements lead to the detection and explanations of new phenomena such as the following: the neutrino oscillations (when and how they were produced and detected, the existence of three types of them and the possibilities that they have mass), the cosmic microwave background radiation (a remnant of the Big Bang when the universe was created producing a spectrum corresponding to black-body radiation), the accelerating expansion of the universe (discovered through observations that some galaxies were rushing away from us and each other, and the farther away they were, the faster they moved), and the existence of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star (the star moved affected by the gravity of its planet).</p> <p>The elements characterizing contextualization of learning (the proposition of a problematic situation, the elaboration of generating questions and the description of learning and evaluation activities) are applied to analyze the content of Peebles\u00b4 Nobel Lecture How Physical Cosmology Grew.</p>"},{"location":"vol-IV/volume-IV/#16-development-of-knowledge-in-high-energy-physics","title":"16.
